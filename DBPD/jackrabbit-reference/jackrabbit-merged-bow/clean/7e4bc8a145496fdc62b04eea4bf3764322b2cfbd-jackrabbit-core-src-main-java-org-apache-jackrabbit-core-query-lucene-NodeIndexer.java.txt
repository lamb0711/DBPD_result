JCR-1686: Catch Throwables while calling TextExtractors

Catch Throwables instead of Exceptions, as suggested by Claus KÃ¶ll. Also, I merged the separate warn and debug log entries into a single warning that contains he exception. That should be easier for structured log readers (related information is  not spread over multiple log entries) and it's easy enough for users to disable the exception stack traces for NodeIndexer warnings if they're too verbose.

-        } catch (Exception e) {
+        } catch (Throwable t) {
-            log.warn("Exception while indexing binary property: " + e.toString());
-            log.debug("Dump: ", e);
+            log.warn("Exception while indexing binary property", t);
