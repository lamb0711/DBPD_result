jcr-commands 
 - naming and packaging reviewed
 - now commands only read parameters from the context because commands shouldn't have a state of their own but use only the context.
 - i18n reorganized in one single resources file
 - batch mode added
 - cover most of jcr operations (versioning, locking, etc.)
 - commands simplified. Most commands don't have default values.
 - logging added
