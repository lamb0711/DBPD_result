Reorganise the ocm project - second step : Remove all Jackrabbit dependencies. 
right now, Jackrabbit is only used for the unit tests. 
RepositoryUtil has been split into 2 distincts classes : 
1/ NodeUtil : utility class for managing jcr nodes. 
2/ RepositoryUtil : utility class to connect & setup a Jackrabbit repo. This could be rename into JackrabbitRepoUtil :-)
