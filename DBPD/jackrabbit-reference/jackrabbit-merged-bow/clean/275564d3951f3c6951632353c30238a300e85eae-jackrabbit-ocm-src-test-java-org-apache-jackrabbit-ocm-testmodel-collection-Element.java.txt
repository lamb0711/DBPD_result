- working on JCR-1339 : better support for Map. It is important to define an ID field in the class used for the Map elements. This ID will be used as a key in the map. 
- Rename ManagedHashMap into ManageableHashMap in ordrer to follow the same naming convention.
- Now, it is not necessary to define the ElementClassName if the Collection or the Map are parametrized like List<MyClass>

-    @Field(jcrName="ocm:id") private String id;
+	// an ID field can be used as a unique identifier (for exemple, it can be used as key in a Map)
+    @Field(jcrName="ocm:id", id=true) private String id;
