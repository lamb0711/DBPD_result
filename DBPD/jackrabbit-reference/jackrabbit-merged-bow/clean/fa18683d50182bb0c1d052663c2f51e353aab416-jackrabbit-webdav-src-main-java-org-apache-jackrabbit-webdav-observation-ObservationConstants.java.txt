Work in progress
- Removed is-local flag from event bundle response and added transaction id which is equal to the lock token that was used to save changes.
- Added TransactionListener. SubscriptionManagerImpl now listens on the TxLockManagerImpl for transaction commits and registers special EventListeners for a short period of time to associate the lockToken / transactionId with an event bundle.
- Remove SubscriptionImpl as event listener when subscription expires
- Update currentVersion to 1.2-SNAPSHOT
