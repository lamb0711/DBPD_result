work in progress

- version always protected
- versionHistory always protected
- fix Node.getReferences && reference properties
- mixinTypes are 'active' upon save only (and not before). therefore
  cleanup after removeMixin is done only after save.
  adding new states defined by a new mixin are only added after the
  node has been saved.
- nodestates identified by a uuid only were created a second time upon
  ChildNodeEntry.resolve => fix needs to be improved
- Events/ChangeLog are processed by the save-target state
- ChangeLog.persisted not used any more
