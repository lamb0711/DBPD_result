+     * If the <code>name</code> parameter is <code>null</code> then all
+     * referring <code>WEAKREFERENCE</code> are returned regardless of name.
+     * <p/>
+     * Some implementations may only return properties that have been persisted.
+     * Some may return both properties that have been persisted and those that
+     * have been dispatched but not persisted (for example, those saved within a
+     * transaction but not yet committed) while others implementations may return
+     * these two categories of property as well as properties that are still
+     * pending and not yet dispatched.
+     * <p/>
+     * In implementations that support versioning, this method does not return
+     * properties that are part of the frozen state of a version in version
+     * storage.
+     * <p/>
+     * If this node has no referring properties with the specified name, an
+     * empty iterator is returned.

+     * returned; if <code>null</code> then all referring
+     * <code>WEAKREFERENCE</code>s are returned.
