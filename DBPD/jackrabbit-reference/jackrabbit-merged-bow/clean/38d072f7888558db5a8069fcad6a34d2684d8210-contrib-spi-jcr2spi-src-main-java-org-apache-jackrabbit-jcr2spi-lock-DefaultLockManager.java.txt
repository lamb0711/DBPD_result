- Restore: pass NodeState(s) and Path instead of NodeId(s)
- LockManager: make sure lockmanager only remembers workspace states
- LockManager: make sure operations are executed using workspace states
- LockManager: improve isLocked/getLock/checkIsLocked and respect locks that
have been accessed before.
- VersionManager: make sure operations are executed using workspace states
- VersionManager: add checkIsCheckedOut
- VersionManager: force manager to have a WorkspaceManager
- NodeReferences:
  > make interface package protected
  > clarify method naming
  > add implementation to WorkspaceItemStateFactory
  > add NodeReferences field to NodeState
  > TO_IMPROVE: references are currently always retrieve from the SPI.
- ItemStateManager + NodeReferences
