JCR-1171: Contribute Pluggable Permission and User Management to Jackrabbit

Moved the o.a.j.commons.iterator.AccessControlPolicyIteratorAdapter class to o.a.j.core.security as it is only accessed from there and we currently (before JSR 283 is final) can't put the class in jcr-commons.

With this change all jackrabbit-core classes are included in o.a.j.core, which makes things easier to track.
