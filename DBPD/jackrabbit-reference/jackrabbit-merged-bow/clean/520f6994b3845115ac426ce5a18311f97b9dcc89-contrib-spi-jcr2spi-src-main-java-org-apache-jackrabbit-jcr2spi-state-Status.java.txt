work in progress.

- nodestates must always be connected to their cne upon creation
  TODO: add some sort of caching to avoid traffic overhead
- add TODO for refresh, that currently doesn't work properly
- ItemState.refresh only takes changelog and returns the ids of the
  processed states. cleanup of events is left to caller.
- move of NodeStates does not work
- PathResolver: force start to be an NodeState
- all MODIFIED status for SessionStates as well in order to make sure
  that listeners are informed about external changes even if the 
  state is EXISTING.

next TODO: make sure, that public getChildNodeEntry/ies and hasChildNodeEntry check for validity of the connected NodeState. don't return entries, where the nodestate is (transiently) removed or stale.
