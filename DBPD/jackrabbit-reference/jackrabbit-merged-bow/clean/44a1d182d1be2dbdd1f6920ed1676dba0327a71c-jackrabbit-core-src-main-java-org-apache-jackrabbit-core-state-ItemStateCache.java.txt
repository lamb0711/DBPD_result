JCR-2699: Improve read/write concurrency

Refactor the LRU cache handling from MLRUItemStateCache and BundleCache to a new LRUCache class. Add a test case for the cache.

Switch from LinkedHashMap to ConcurrentHashMap with explicitly managed LRU linked list to reduce the size of the synchronized blocks.
