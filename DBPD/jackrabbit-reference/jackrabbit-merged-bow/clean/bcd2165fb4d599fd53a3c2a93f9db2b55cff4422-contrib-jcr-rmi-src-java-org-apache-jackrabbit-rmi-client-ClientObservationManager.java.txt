JCR-RMI: Patch contributed by Felix Meschberger: "And here we go with another patch :-) It contains an optimization in the ClientSession, which now contains its own live flag which is consulted by the isLive() method in addition to the remote session. The second fix concerns the ClientEventPoller, which continues polling even though the session has already been logged out. The fix is to check the live status with the session and terminating the poll cycle if not alive anymore."
Also modified the unit tests accordingly.
