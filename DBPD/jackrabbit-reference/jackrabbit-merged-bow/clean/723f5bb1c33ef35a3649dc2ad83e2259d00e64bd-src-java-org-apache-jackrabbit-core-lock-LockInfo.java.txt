-     * When the owning session is logging out, we should unlock the node on
-     * behalf of the user currently holding it.
+     * When the owning session is logging out, we have to perform some
+     * operations depending on the lock type.
+     * (1) If the lock was session-scoped, we unlock the node.
+     * (2) If the lock was open-scoped, we remove the lock token
+     *     from the session.
