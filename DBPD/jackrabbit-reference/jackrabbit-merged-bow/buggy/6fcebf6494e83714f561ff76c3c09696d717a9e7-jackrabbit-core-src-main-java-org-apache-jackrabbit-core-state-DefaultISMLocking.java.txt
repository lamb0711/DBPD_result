JCR-2000: Deadlock on concurrent commits

Use DefaultISMLocking as the versioning lock to get the same JCR-1334 support for versioning as was already implemented for default workspace locking.

Make all transactions acquire the versioning lock regardless of whether versioning changes are included in the transaction. This prevents potential deadlocks as even a non-versioning commit will access the version store for reference checks.
