JCR-2089: Use java.util.concurrent

After the refactoring of DefaultISMLocking it's no longer possible (even in theory) for WriteLock.downgrade() to throw InterruptedExceptions, so we can safely remove the throws declaration.

There should never be a reason for downgrade() to block, so the method should not be declared to throw InterruptedExceptions.

-         * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread is interrupted
-         *                              while downgrading the write lock.
-        ReadLock downgrade() throws InterruptedException;
+        ReadLock downgrade();
