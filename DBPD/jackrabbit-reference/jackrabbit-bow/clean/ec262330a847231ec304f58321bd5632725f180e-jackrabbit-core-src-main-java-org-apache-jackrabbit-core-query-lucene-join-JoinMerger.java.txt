+/**
+ * A join merger is used by the {@link QueryEngine} class to efficiently
+ * merge together two parts of a join query.
+ * <p>
+ * Each join condition type ({@link EquiJoinCondition equi-} and
+ * {@link SameNodeJoinCondition same}, {@link ChildNodeJoinCondition child}
+ * or {@link DescendantJoinCondition descendant} node joins) has it's own
+ * merger class that extends the functionality of this abstract base class
+ * with functionality specific to that join condition.
