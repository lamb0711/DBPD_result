JCR-3198: Broken handling of outer join results over davex

Return the set of selector names as a part of the response description field along with column names.

For compatibility with earlier clients/servers this new functionality (and extensible) functionality is only enabled when the search request is made with the query language qualified with the JCR WebDAV extension namespace.
