+     * Create a condition which holds iff the name of the {@link Authorizable}
+     * matches a <code>pattern</code>.
+     * The percent character �%� represents any string of zero or more characters and the
+     * underscore character �_� represents any single character. Any literal use of these characters
+     * and the backslash character �\� must be escaped with a backslash character.
+     * The pattern is matched against the {@link Authorizable#getID() id} and the
+     * {@link Authorizable#getPrincipal() principal}.
+     *
+     * @param pattern  Pattern to match the property at <code>relPath</code> against
+     * @return  A condition
