+ * <h3><a name="mread">Multi Read</a></h3>
+ * <p>
+ * Since Jackrabbit 2.3.1 it is also possible to request multiple subtrees
+ * in a single request. This is done by sending a GET or a POST request to
+ * a workspace request and specifying the paths of the selected subtrees
+ * as ":path" parameters of the request. The response is a JSON object
+ * whose "nodes" property contains all the selected nodes keyed by
+ * path. Missing nodes are not included in the response. Each included
+ * node is serialized as defined above for <a href="#bread">batch read</a>.
+ * The configured default subtree depth can be overridden by specifying the
+ * optional ":depth" parameter.
+ * <p>
+ * Example:
+ * <pre>
+ * $ curl 'http://localhost:8080/server/default?:path=/node1&:path=/node2'
+ * {"nodes":{"/node1":{...},"/node2":{...}}}
+ * </pre>
