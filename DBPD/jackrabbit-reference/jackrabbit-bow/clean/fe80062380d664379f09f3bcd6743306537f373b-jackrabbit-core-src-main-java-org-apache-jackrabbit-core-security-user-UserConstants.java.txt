JCR-2313: Improvements to user management (2)  [NOTE: work in progress]

-> removed from node type definition and adjusted impl accordingly

+     * @deprecated As of 2.0 the id-hash is stored with the jcr:uuid making the
+     * rep:userId property redundant. It has been removed from the node type
+     * definition.
