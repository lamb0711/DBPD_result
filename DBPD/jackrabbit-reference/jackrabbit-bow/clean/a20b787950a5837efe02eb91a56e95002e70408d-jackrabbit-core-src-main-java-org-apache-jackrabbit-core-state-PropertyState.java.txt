JCR-2699: Improve read/write concurrency

Update node and property state size estimates to better mach the improved NodeId and Name classes and the fact that those objects are also shared between multiple states.
Also remove the effect of the now removed node and prop def identifiers on the item state size calculations.

+    @Override
-        private PropDefId defId;
-        we assume an average Name localname of 30 chars.
-        PropertyId = 8 + nodeId(36) * name(250) + hash(4) ~ 300;
-        NodeDefId = 8 + id(4) = 12
+        We assume only 16 bytes per name or node id,
+        as they are shared between states
+        PropertyId = 8 + nodeId(16) + name(16) + hash(4) ~ 44;
-        return 350 + values.length * 100;
+        return 64 + values.length * 100;
