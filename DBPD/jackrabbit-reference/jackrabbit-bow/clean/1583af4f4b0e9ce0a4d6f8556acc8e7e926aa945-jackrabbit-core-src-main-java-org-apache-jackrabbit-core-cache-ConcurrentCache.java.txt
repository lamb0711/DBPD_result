JCR-2699: Improve read/write concurrency

Use a constant for the default number of cache segments to use, as computing the number of available processors can be quite expensive.

+     * Default number of cache segments to use. Use the number of available
+     * processors (even if that might change during runtime!) as a reasonable
+     * approximation of the amount of parallelism we should expect in the
+     * worst case.
+     * <p>
+     * One reason for this value being a constant is that the
+     * {@link Runtime#availableProcessors()} call is somewhat expensive at
+     * least in some environments.
