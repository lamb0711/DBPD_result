Refactoring

- separate hierarchy from ItemStates
- remove ItemStateManager
- move all hierarchy related classes to a separate package ('hierarchy')
- allow loading of deep Item without loading ancestors
- consequently item definition is only built upon usage, since parent is needed.
- minor fixes with adding/removing mixin-nodetypes

Consequences for SPI interfaces:

- SPI impl must be able to deal with both proper itemID and path, since jcr2spi
  might not be aware of a uniqueID defined with a parent node.

- ItemInfo.getPath added, in order to be able to built the missing hierarchy
  entries if a deep Item identified by uniqueID (plus ev. path) is loaded

- LockInfo.getNodeId added, in order to be able to determine the lock-holding node.
