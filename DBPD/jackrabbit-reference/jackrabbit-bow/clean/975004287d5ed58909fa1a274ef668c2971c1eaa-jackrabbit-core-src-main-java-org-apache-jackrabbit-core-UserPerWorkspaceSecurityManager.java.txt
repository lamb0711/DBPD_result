JCR-2749: Closing a session twice shouldn't write a warning in the log

Use an explicit "active" flag instead of the activeSessions set to mark workspaces that shouldn't get disposed by the workspace janitor. This way the repository won't prematurely close the system session during shutdown.

-                    repo.onSessionCreated(systemSession);
+                    repo.markWorkspaceActive(wspName);
