work in progress

- operations: rename getAffectedIds to getAffectedStates
- operations: return ItemState params instead of ids whereever possible and
  let OperationVisitor deal with all kind of issues arising with SPI ids.
- AddNode/AddProperty operations: don't list state to be created as affected. Not required since operations are collected upon refresh/save, in which case a 'new' item can never be the starting point.
- transient move: let parent NodeState handle the move/renaming of child states
- transient reorder: let parent NodeState handle the reorder logic
- NodeState: remove unused methods and mark setParent private
- NodeImpl: protected getNodeId() no more used by subclasses in version package.
