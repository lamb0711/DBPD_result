- Prepared package structure for tck tests under org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api
- Restructured test base classes for easier integration into javatest
- Test classes under test.api package are considered as sample tck tests. in contrast to tests in e.g. test/observation; those must be considered implementation specific sample test. not all repos will support nt:unstructured.
