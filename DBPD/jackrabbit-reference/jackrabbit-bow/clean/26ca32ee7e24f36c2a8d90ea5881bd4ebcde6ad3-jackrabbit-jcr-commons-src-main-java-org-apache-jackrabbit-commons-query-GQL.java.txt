Adding support for escape sequence. Escape sequence character is backslash. Only double-quotes (as \"), backslash (as \\) and colon (as \:) characters can be escaped.

+ * <b>Escaping</b>
+ * <p>
+ * To imply double-quotes(&quot;), backslash(\), and colon(:) literally you can
+ * escape them with a backslash. E.g. similar to example above in quoting for colon,
+ * <code>"jcr:title":apache</code> is equiavalent to jcr\:title:apache.
+ * <p>
+        boolean escaped = false;
