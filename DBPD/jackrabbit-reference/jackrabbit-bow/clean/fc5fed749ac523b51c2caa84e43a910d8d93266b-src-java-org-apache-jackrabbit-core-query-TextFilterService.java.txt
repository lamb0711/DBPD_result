JCR-229: Decouple packages in core.query
- TextPlainTextFilter moved to sub package o.a.j.c.query.lucene
- Introduced interface QueryTreeBuilder that allows to implement arbitrary syntax that can be represented with a QueryNode tree specified in package o.a.j.c.query. XPath and SQL syntax are now implemented via this interface.
