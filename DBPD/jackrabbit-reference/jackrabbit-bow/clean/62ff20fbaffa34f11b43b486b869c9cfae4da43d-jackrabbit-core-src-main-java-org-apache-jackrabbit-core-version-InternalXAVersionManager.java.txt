JCR-2865: a dead lock in DefaultISMLocking

Use an older 2.1 version of the DefaultISMLocking as a separate VersioningLock class in the version manager.

This decouples the read-write lock functionality in the version manager from the more performance-critical ISM locking and fixes the accidental deadlocks caused by the ISM locking optimizations.
