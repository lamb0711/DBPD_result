- Create a factory method in ChildNodeReference, which creates a UUIDReference or a PathElementReference based on the availability of a UUID in the child NodeState.
- Introduce a propertiesInAttic in NodeState, which contains properties that are marked removed in the transient space and have been overlayed with a new property with the same name.
- Reviewed NodeState.moveChildNodeEntry()
- Removed unused NodeStateListener.
