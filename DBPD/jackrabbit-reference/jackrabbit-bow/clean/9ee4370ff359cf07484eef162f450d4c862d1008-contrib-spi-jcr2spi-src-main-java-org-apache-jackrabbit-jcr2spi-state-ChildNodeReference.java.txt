SPI
- replace ChildNodeEntryImpl with new implementations
- CachingItemStateManager now uses ItemStateFactory
- WorkspaceManager implements ItemStateFactory
- Retrieving an ItemState now forces loading all ancestors by design
- NodeState does not maintain indexes of child node entries anymore. They are calculated on demand.
- ItemStateFactory methods do not require parent NodeState anymore. The parent NodeState is retrieved using an ItemStateManager. Which in turn may lead to recursive retrieval of ancestors if necessary.
