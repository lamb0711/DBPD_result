+ * or older than the given date. if no such version exists, the initial one
+ * is restored.<br/>
+ * The <code>Node.restoreByLabel()</code> uses the
+ * {@link LabelVersionSelector} which is initialized with the label of the
+ * version to be restored. This selector selectes the version with the same
+ * label. if no such version exists, the initial one is restored.
