JCR-2699: Improve read/write concurrency

It's better to allow the occasional cache overwrite than to block concurrent threads. The locking in SessionState and SISM already prevent concurrent read/write operations that could possibly lead to inconsistencies.

-                // Use a double check to ensure that the cache entry is
-                // not created twice. We don't synchronize the entire
-                // method to allow the first cache retrieval to proceed
-                // even when another thread is loading a new item state.
-                ItemState cachedState = cache.retrieve(id);
-                if (cachedState == null) {
-                    // put it in cache
-                    cache.cache(state);
-                    // set parent container
-                    state.setContainer(this);
-                } else {
-                    state = cachedState;
-                }
-            }
