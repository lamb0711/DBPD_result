 JCR-1588: JSR 283: Access Control

- align principalbased ac editing with latest changes made to JSR 283
   -> getApplicablePolicies(Principal) only returns policies that have not yet been set
   -> getPolicies(Principal) added -> used to modify policies that have been set before

- WorkspaceAccessManagerImpl.grants throws NoSuchWorkspaceException if an invalid
   wspName gets passed... TCK tests would fail if not executed with admin user that
   is covered by shortcut.

- Various improvements to AccessControlProvider handling
   > prevent closure of used provider
   > add AccessControlProvider#isLive that allows to rebuild the provider if it was closed before

- Simplify WriteTest and add test for changes made to principal-based ACLEditor

JCR-2087 Upgrade to Java 5 as the base platform
- use generics in security code (work in progress)
