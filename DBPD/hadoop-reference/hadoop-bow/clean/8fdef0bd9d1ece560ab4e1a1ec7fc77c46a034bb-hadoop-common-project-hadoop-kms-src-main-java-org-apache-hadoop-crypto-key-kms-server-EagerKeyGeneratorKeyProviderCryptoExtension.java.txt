HADOOP-12699. TestKMS#testKMSProvider intermittently fails during 'test rollover draining'. Contributed by Xiao Chen.

+  /**
+   * Roll a new version of the given key generating the material for it.
+   * <p>
+   * Due to the caching on the ValueQueue, even after a rollNewVersion call,
+   * {@link #generateEncryptedKey(String)} may still return an old key - even
+   * when we drain the queue here, the async thread may later fill in old keys.
+   * This is acceptable since old version keys are still able to decrypt, and
+   * client shall make no assumptions that it will get a new versioned key
+   * after rollNewVersion.
