-    // TODO(HA): Have to figure out a story for the first 3 of these.
-        // TODO(HA): Fix this.
-    // TODO(HA): This should probably always return false when HA is enabled and
-    // we're coming up in standby state.
-      // TODO(HA): this may be very slow -- we probably want to
-      // update them as we go for HA.
