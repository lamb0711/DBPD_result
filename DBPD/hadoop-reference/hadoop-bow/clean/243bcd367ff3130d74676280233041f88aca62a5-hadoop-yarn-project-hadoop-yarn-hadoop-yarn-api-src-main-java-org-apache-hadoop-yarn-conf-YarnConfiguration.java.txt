+  /**
+   * Maximum number of proxy connections for node manager. It should always be
+   * more than 1. NMClient and MRAppMaster will use this to cache connection
+   * with node manager. There will be at max one connection per node manager.
+   * Ex. configuring it to a value of 5 will make sure that client will at
+   * max have 5 connections cached with 5 different node managers. These
+   * connections will be timed out if idle for more than system wide idle
+   * timeout period. The token if used for authentication then it will be used
+   * only at connection creation time. If new token is received then earlier
+   * connection should be closed in order to use newer token.
+   * Note: {@link YarnConfiguration#NM_CLIENT_ASYNC_THREAD_POOL_MAX_SIZE}
+   * are related to each other.
