+ * <p>Note that <code>hashCode()</code> is frequently used in Hadoop to partition
+ * keys. It's important that your implementation of hashCode() returns the same 
+ * result across different instances of the JVM. Note also that the default 
+ * <code>hashCode()</code> implementation in <code>Object</code> does <b>not</b>
+ * satisfy this property.</p>
