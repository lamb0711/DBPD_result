+  
+   * Until version 9, this class ClientDatanodeProtocol served as both
+   * the client interface to the DN AND the RPC protocol used to 
+   * communicate with the NN.
+   * 
+   * Post version 10 (release 23 of Hadoop), the protocol is implemented in
+   * {@literal ../protocolR23Compatible/ClientDatanodeWireProtocol}
+   * 
+   * This class is used by both the DFSClient and the 
+   * DN server side to insulate from the protocol serialization.
+   * 
+   * If you are adding/changing DN's interface then you need to 
+   * change both this class and ALSO
+   * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocolR23Compatible.ClientDatanodeWireProtocol}.
+   * These changes need to be done in a compatible fashion as described in 
+   * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocolR23Compatible.ClientNamenodeWireProtocol}
+   * 
+   * The log of historical changes can be retrieved from the svn).
+   * 
+   * 9 is the last version id when this class was used for protocols
+   *  serialization. DO not update this version any further. 
+   *  Changes are recorded in R23 classes.
