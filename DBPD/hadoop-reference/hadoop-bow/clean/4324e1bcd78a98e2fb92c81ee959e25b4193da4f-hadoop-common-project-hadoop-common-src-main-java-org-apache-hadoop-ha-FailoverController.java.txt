+   * An option to ignore toSvc if it claims it is not ready to
+   * become active is provided in case performing a failover will
+   * allow it to become active, eg because it triggers a log roll
+   * so the standby can learn about new blocks and leave safemode.
+   *
+   * @param forceActive ignore toSvc if it reports that it is not ready
