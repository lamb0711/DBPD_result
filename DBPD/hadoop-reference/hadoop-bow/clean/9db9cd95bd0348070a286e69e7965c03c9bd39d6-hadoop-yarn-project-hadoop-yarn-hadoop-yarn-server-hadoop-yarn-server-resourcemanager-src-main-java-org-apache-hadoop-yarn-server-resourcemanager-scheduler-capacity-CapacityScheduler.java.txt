YARN-7003. DRAINING state of queues is not recovered after RM restart. Contributed by Tao Yang.

+import org.apache.hadoop.yarn.api.records.QueueState;
+      // When recovering apps in this queue but queue is in STOPPED state,
+      // that means its previous state was DRAINING. So we auto transit
+      // the state to DRAINING for recovery.
+      if (queue.getState() == QueueState.STOPPED) {
+        ((LeafQueue) queue).recoverDrainingState();
+      }
