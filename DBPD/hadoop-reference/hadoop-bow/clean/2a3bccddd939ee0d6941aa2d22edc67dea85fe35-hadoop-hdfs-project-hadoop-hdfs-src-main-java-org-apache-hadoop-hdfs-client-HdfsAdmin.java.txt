-   * Delete the encryption zone rooted at path. Path must refer to an existing,
-   * empty directory. Otherwise, an IOException is thrown. This method removes
-   * those extended attributes on the directory which indicate that it is part
-   * of an encryption zone. Following successful completion of this call, any
-   * new files created in the directory (or it's children) will not be
-   * encrypted. The directory is not removed by this method.
-   *
-   * @param path The path of the root of the encryption zone.
-   *
-   * @throws IOException if there was a general IO exception
-   *
-   * @throws AccessControlException if the caller does not have access to path
-   *
-   * @throws FileNotFoundException if the path does not exist
