HADOOP-16580. Disable retry of FailoverOnNetworkExceptionRetry in case of AccessControlException. Contributed by Adam Antal

+ * to test any class's behaviour where an underlying interface or class
+ * may throw exceptions.
+ *
+ * Some methods may be annotated with the {@link Idempotent} annotation.
+ * In order to test those some methods of UnreliableInterface are annotated,
+ * but they are not actually Idempotent functions.
