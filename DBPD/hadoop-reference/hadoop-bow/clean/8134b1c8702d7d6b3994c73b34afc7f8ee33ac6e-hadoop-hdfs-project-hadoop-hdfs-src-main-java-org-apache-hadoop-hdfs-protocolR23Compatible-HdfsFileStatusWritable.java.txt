Merge trunk into HA branch.

Several conflicts around introduction of protobuf translator for DatanodeProtocol - mostly trivial resolutions.

NB: this does not successfully pass any tests since the HAStatus field needs
to be integrated into the HeartbeatResponse Protobuf implementation.
That will be a separate commit for clearer history.
