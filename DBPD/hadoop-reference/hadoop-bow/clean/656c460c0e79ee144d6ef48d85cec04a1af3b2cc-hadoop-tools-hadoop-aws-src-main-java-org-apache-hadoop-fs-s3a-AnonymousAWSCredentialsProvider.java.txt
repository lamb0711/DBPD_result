HADOOP-13237: s3a initialization against public bucket fails if caller lacks any credentials. Contributed by Chris Nauroth

+/**
+ * AnonymousAWSCredentialsProvider supports anonymous access to AWS services
+ * through the AWS SDK.  AWS requests will not be signed.  This is not suitable
+ * for most cases, because allowing anonymous access to an S3 bucket compromises
+ * security.  This can be useful for accessing public data sets without
+ * requiring AWS credentials.
+ *
+ * Please note that users may reference this class name from configuration
+ * property fs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider.  Therefore, changing the class name
+ * would be a backward-incompatible change.
