-   * Increment number of safe blocks if current block has reached minimal
-   * replication.
+   * Increment number of safe blocks if the current block is contiguous
+   * and it has reached minimal replication or
+   * if the current block is striped and the number of its actual data blocks
+   * reaches the number of data units specified by the erasure coding policy.
-    final int safe = storedBlock.isStriped() ?
+    final int safeNumberOfNodes = storedBlock.isStriped() ?
-    if (storageNum == safe) {
+    if (storageNum == safeNumberOfNodes) {
-   * Decrement number of safe blocks if current block has fallen below minimal
-   * replication.
+   * Decrement number of safe blocks if the current block is contiguous
+   * and it has just fallen below minimal replication or
+   * if the current block is striped and its actual data blocks has just fallen
+   * below the number of data units specified by erasure coding policy.
+    final int safeNumberOfNodes = b.isStriped() ?
+        ((BlockInfoStriped)b).getRealDataBlockNum() : safeReplication;
