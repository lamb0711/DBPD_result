HADOOP-16920 ABFS: Make list page size configurable.


Contributed by Bilahari T H.

The page limit is set in "fs.azure.list.max.results"; default value is 500. 

There's currently a limit of 5000 in the store -there are no range checks
in the client code so that limit can be changed on the server without
any need to update the abfs connector.
+  public static final int DEFAULT_AZURE_LIST_MAX_RESULTS = 500;
