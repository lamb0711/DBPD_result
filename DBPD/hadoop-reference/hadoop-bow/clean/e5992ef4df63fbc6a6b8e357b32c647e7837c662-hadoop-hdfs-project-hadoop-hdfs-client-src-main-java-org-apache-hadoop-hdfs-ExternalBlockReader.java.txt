HDFS-9147. Fix the setting of visibleLength in ExternalBlockReader.  (Colin P. McCabe via Lei (Eddy) Xu)

-    // You can't skip past the end of the replica.
+    // You can't skip past the last offset that we want to read with this
+    // block reader.
-    // We return the amount of bytes that we haven't read yet from the
-    // replica, based on our current position.  Some of the other block
-    // readers return a shorter length than that.  The only advantage to
-    // returning a shorter length is that the DFSInputStream will
-    // trash your block reader and create a new one if someone tries to
-    // seek() beyond the available() region.
