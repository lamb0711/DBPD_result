Addendum patch for YARN-5731

+   * By default, reserved resource will be excluded while balancing capacities
+   * of queues.
+   *
+   * Why doing this? In YARN-4390, we added preemption-based-on-reserved-container
+   * Support. To reduce unnecessary preemption for large containers. We will
+   * not include reserved resources while calculating ideal-allocation in
+   * FifoCandidatesSelector.
+   *
+   * Changes in YARN-4390 will significantly reduce number of containers preempted
+   * When cluster has heterogeneous container requests. (Please check test
+   * report: https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12796197/YARN-4390-test-results.pdf
+   *
+   * However, on the other hand, in some corner cases, especially for
+   * fragmented cluster. It could lead to preemption cannot kick in in some
+   * cases. Please see YARN-5731.
+   *
+   * So to solve the problem, make this change to be configurable, and please
+   * note that it is an experimental option.
