+ * Synchronization between {@link #writeStateMachineData} and
+ * {@link #applyTransaction} need to be enforced in the StateMachine
+ * implementation. For example, synchronization between writeChunk and
+ * createContainer in {@link ContainerStateMachine}.
+  /*
+   * writeStateMachineData calls are not synchronized with each other
+   * and also with applyTransaction.
+   */
+  /*
+   * ApplyTransaction calls in Ratis are sequential.
