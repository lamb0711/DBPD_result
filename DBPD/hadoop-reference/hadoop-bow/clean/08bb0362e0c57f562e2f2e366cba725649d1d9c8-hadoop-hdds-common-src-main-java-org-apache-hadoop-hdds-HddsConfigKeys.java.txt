HDDS-759. Create config settings for SCM and OM DB directories. Contributed by Arpit Agarwal.

+  // This configuration setting is used as a fallback location by all
+  // Ozone/HDDS services for their metadata. It is useful as a single
+  // config point for test/PoC clusters.
+  //
+  // In any real cluster where performance matters, the SCM, OM and DN
+  // metadata locations must be configured explicitly.
