+ * to be created in the working directory of the child task.  In the current 
+ * version symlinks are always created.  If the URL does not have a fragment 
+ * the name of the file or directory will be used. If multiple files or 
+ * directories map to the same link name, the last one added, will be used.  All
+ * others will not even be downloaded.</p>
