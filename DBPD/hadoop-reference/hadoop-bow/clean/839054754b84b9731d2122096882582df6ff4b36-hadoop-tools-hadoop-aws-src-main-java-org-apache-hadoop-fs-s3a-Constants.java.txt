HADOOP-16792: Make S3 client request timeout configurable.

Contributed by Mustafa Iman.

This adds a new configuration option fs.s3a.connection.request.timeout
to declare the time out on HTTP requests to the AWS service;
0 means no timeout.
Measured in seconds; the usual time suffixes are all supported

Important: this is the maximum duration of any AWS service call,
including upload and copy operations. If non-zero, it must be larger
than the time to upload multi-megabyte blocks to S3 from the client,
and to rename many-GB files. Use with care.
