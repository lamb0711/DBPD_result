HDFS-6750. The DataNode should use its shared memory segment to mark short-circuit replicas that have been unlinked as stale (cmccabe)

- * closes unexpectedly, we mark the slots inside this segment as stale.
- * ShortCircuitReplica objects that contain stale slots are themselves stale,
+ * closes unexpectedly, we mark the slots inside this segment as disconnected.
+ * ShortCircuitReplica objects that contain disconnected slots are stale,
+ *
+ * Slots may also become stale because the associated replica has been deleted
+ * on the DataNode.  In this case, the DataNode will clear the 'valid' bit.
+ * The client will then see these slots as stale (see
+ * #{ShortCircuitReplica#isStale}).
