+   *             Note: Instead of sending this command,
+   *             {@link ApplicationMasterNotRegisteredException} will be thrown
+   *             when ApplicationMaster is out of sync with ResourceManager and
+   *             ApplicationMaster is expected to re-register with RM by calling
+   *             {@link ApplicationMasterProtocol#registerApplicationMaster(RegisterApplicationMasterRequest)}

-   * Sent by Resource Manager when it wants the AM to shutdown. Eg. when the 
-   * node is going down for maintenance. The AM should save any state and 
-   * prepare to be restarted at a later time.

+   *             Note: This command was earlier sent by ResourceManager to
+   *             instruct AM to shutdown if RM had restarted. Now
+   *             {@link ApplicationAttemptNotFoundException} will be thrown in case
+   *             that RM has restarted and AM is supposed to handle this
+   *             exception by shutting down itself.
