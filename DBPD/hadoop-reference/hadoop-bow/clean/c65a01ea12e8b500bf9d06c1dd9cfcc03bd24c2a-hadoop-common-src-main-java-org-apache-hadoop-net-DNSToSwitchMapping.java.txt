-   * Resolves a list of DNS-names/IP-addresses and returns back a list of
-   * switch information (network paths). One-to-one correspondence must be 
-   * maintained between the elements in the lists. 
-   * Consider an element in the argument list - x.y.com. The switch information
-   * that is returned must be a network path of the form /foo/rack, 
-   * where / is the root, and 'foo' is the switch where 'rack' is connected.
-   * Note the hostname/ip-address is not part of the returned path.
-   * The network topology of the cluster would determine the number of
-   * components in the network path.  Unlike 'resolve', names must be 
-   * resolvable
-   * @param names
-   * @return list of resolved network paths
-   * @throws UnknownHostException if any hosts are not resolvable
