HADOOP-16458. LocatedFileStatusFetcher.getFileStatuses failing intermittently with S3

Contributed by Steve Loughran.

Includes
-S3A glob scans don't bother trying to resolve symlinks
-stack traces don't get lost in getFileStatuses() when exceptions are wrapped
-debug level logging of what is up in Globber
-Contains HADOOP-13373. Add S3A implementation of FSMainOperationsBaseTest.
-ITestRestrictedReadAccess tests incomplete read access to files.

This adds a builder API for constructing globbers which other stores can use
so that they too can skip symlink resolution when not needed.
