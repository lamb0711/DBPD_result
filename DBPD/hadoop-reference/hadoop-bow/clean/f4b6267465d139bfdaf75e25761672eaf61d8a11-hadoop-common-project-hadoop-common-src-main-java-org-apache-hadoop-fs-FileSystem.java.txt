+   * In HDFS, if file is three-replicated, the returned array contains
+   * elements like:
+   * <pre>
+   * BlockLocation(offset: 0, length: BLOCK_SIZE,
+   *   hosts: {"host1:9866", "host2:9866, host3:9866"})
+   * BlockLocation(offset: BLOCK_SIZE, length: BLOCK_SIZE,
+   *   hosts: {"host2:9866", "host3:9866, host4:9866"})
+   * </pre>
+   *
+   * And if a file is erasure-coded, the returned BlockLocation are logical
+   * block groups.
+   *
+   * Suppose we have a RS_3_2 coded file (3 data units and 2 parity units).
+   * 1. If the file size is less than one stripe size, say 2 * CELL_SIZE, then
+   * there will be one BlockLocation returned, with 0 offset, actual file size
+   * and 4 hosts (2 data blocks and 2 parity blocks) hosting the actual blocks.
+   * 3. If the file size is less than one group size but greater than one
+   * stripe size, then there will be one BlockLocation returned, with 0 offset,
+   * actual file size with 5 hosts (3 data blocks and 2 parity blocks) hosting
+   * the actual blocks.
+   * 4. If the file size is greater than one group size, 3 * BLOCK_SIZE + 123
+   * for example, then the result will be like:
+   * <pre>
+   * BlockLocation(offset: 0, length: 3 * BLOCK_SIZE, hosts: {"host1:9866",
+   *   "host2:9866","host3:9866","host4:9866","host5:9866"})
+   * BlockLocation(offset: 3 * BLOCK_SIZE, length: 123, hosts: {"host1:9866",
+   *   "host4:9866", "host5:9866"})
+   * </pre>
