Merging r1527684 through r1532876 from trunk to branch HDFS-2832

git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/branches/HDFS-2832@1532910 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68

- * <p>Currrently it only models <em>memory</em>.</p>
+ * <p>Currently it models both <em>memory</em> and <em>CPU</em>.</p>
+ * 
+ * <p>The unit for memory is megabytes. CPU is modeled with virtual cores
+ * (vcores), a unit for expressing parallelism. A node's capacity should
+ * be configured with virtual cores equal to its number of physical cores. A
+ * container should be requested with the number of cores it can saturate, i.e.
+ * the average number of threads it expects to have runnable at a time.</p>
+ * 
+ * <p>Virtual cores take integer values and thus currently CPU-scheduling is
+ * very coarse.  A complementary axis for CPU requests that represents processing
+ * power will likely be added in the future to enable finer-grained resource
+ * configuration.</p>
-   * We refer to <em>virtual cores</em> to clarify that these represent
-   * <em>normalized</em> cores which may have a m:n relationship w.r.t
-   * physical cores available on the compute nodes. Furthermore, they also 
-   * represent <em>idealized</em> cores since the cluster might be composed
-   * of <em>heterogenous</em> nodes.
