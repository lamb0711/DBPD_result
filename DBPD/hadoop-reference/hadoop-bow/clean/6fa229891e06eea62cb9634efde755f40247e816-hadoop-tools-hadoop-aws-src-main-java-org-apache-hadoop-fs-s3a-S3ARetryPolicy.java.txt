HADOOP-15625. S3A input stream to use etags/version number to detect changed source files.

Author: Ben Roling <ben.roling@gmail.com>

Initial patch from Brahma Reddy Battula.

+    // once the file has changed, trying again is not going to help
+    policyMap.put(RemoteFileChangedException.class, fail);
+
+    // likely only recovered by changing the policy configuration or s3
+    // implementation
+    policyMap.put(NoVersionAttributeException.class, fail);
+
