HADOOP-8174. Remove confusing comment in Path#isAbsolute() (Contributed by Suresh Srinivas)

- * absolute if it begins with a slash.
+ * Path strings use slash as the directory separator.
-  /** True if the path component of this URI is absolute. */
-  /**
-   * There is some ambiguity here. An absolute path is a slash
-   * relative name without a scheme or an authority.
-   * So either this method was incorrectly named or its
-   * implementation is incorrect. This method returns true
-   * even if there is a scheme and authority.
