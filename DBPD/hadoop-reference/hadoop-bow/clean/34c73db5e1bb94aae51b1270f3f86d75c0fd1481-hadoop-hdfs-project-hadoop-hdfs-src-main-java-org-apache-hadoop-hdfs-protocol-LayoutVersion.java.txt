+   * Version in which HDFS-2991 was fixed. This bug caused OP_ADD to
+   * sometimes be skipped for append() calls. If we see such a case when
+   * loading the edits, but the version is known to have that bug, we
+   * workaround the issue. Otherwise we should consider it a corruption
+   * and bail.
