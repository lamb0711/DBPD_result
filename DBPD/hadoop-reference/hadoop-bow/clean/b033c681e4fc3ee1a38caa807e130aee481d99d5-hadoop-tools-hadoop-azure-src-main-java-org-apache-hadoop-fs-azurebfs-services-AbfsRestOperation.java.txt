HADOOP-16612. Track Azure Blob File System client-perceived latency

Contributed by Jeetesh Mangwani.

This add the ability to track the end-to-end performance of ADLS Gen 2 REST APIs by measuring latency in the Hadoop ABFS driver.
The latency information is sent back to the ADLS Gen 2 REST API endpoints in the subsequent requests.

+    // see if we have latency reports from the previous requests
+    String latencyHeader = this.client.getAbfsPerfTracker().getClientLatency();
+    if (latencyHeader != null && !latencyHeader.isEmpty()) {
+      AbfsHttpHeader httpHeader =
+              new AbfsHttpHeader(HttpHeaderConfigurations.X_MS_ABFS_CLIENT_LATENCY, latencyHeader);
+      requestHeaders.add(httpHeader);
+    }
