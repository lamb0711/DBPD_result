+   * Performs an authentication management operation.
+   * <p/>
+   * This is useful for handling operations like get/renew/cancel
+   * delegation tokens which are being handled as operations of the
+   * service end-point.
+   * <p/>
+   * If the method returns <code>TRUE</code> the request will continue normal
+   * processing, this means the method has not produced any HTTP response.
+   * <p/>
+   * If the method returns <code>FALSE</code> the request will end, this means 
+   * the method has produced the corresponding HTTP response.
+   *
+   * @param token the authentication token if any, otherwise <code>NULL</code>.
+   * @param request the HTTP client request.
+   * @param response the HTTP client response.
+   * @return <code>TRUE</code> if the request should be processed as a regular
+   * request,
+   * <code>FALSE</code> otherwise.
+   *
+   * @throws IOException thrown if an IO error occurred.
+   * @throws AuthenticationException thrown if an Authentication error occurred.
