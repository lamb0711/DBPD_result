YARN-6256. Add FROM_ID info key for timeline entities in reader response (Rohith Sharma K S via Varun Saxena)

- * <li><b>fromIdPrefix</b> - If specified, retrieve entities with an id prefix
- * greater than or equal to the specified fromIdPrefix. If fromIdPrefix is same
- * for all entities of a given entity type, then the user must provide fromId as
- * a filter to denote the start entity from which further entities will be
- * fetched. fromIdPrefix is mandatory even in the case the entity id prefix is
- * not used and should be set to 0.</li>
- * <li><b>fromId</b> - If specified along with fromIdPrefix, retrieve entities
- * with an id prefix greater than or equal to specified id prefix in
- * fromIdPrefix and entity id lexicographically greater than or equal to entity
- * id specified in fromId. Please note than fromIdPrefix is mandatory if fromId
- * is specified, otherwise, the filter will be ignored. It is recommended to
- * provide both fromIdPrefix and fromId filters for more accurate results as id
- * prefix may not be unique for an entity.</li>
+ * <li><b>fromId</b> - If specified, retrieve the next set of entities from the
+ * given fromId. The set of entities retrieved is inclusive of specified fromId.
+ * fromId should be taken from the value associated with FROM_ID info key in
+ * entity response which was sent earlier.</li>
