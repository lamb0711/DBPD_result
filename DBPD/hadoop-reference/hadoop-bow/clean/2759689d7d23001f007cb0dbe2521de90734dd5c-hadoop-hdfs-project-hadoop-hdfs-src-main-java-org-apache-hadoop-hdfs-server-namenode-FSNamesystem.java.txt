HDFS-9239. DataNode Lifeline Protocol: an alternative protocol for reporting DataNode liveness. Contributed by Chris Nauroth.

+   * Handles a lifeline message sent by a DataNode.  This method updates contact
+   * information and statistics for the DataNode, so that it doesn't time out.
+   * Unlike a heartbeat, this method does not dispatch any commands back to the
+   * DataNode for local execution.  This method also cannot request a lease for
+   * sending a full block report.  Lifeline messages are used only as a fallback
+   * in case something prevents successful delivery of heartbeat messages.
+   * Therefore, the implementation of this method must remain lightweight
+   * compared to heartbeat handling.  It should avoid lock contention and
+   * expensive computation.
+   *
+   * @param nodeReg registration info for DataNode sending the lifeline
+   * @param reports storage reports from DataNode
+   * @param cacheCapacity cache capacity at DataNode
+   * @param cacheUsed cache used at DataNode
+   * @param xceiverCount estimated count of transfer threads running at DataNode
+   * @param xmitsInProgress count of transfers running at DataNode
+   * @param failedVolumes count of failed volumes at DataNode
+   * @param volumeFailureSummary info on failed volumes at DataNode
+   * @throws IOException if there is an error
