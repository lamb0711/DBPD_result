HADOOP-16746. mkdirs and s3guard Authoritative mode.

Contributed by Steve Loughran.

This fixes two problems with S3Guard authoritative mode and
the auth directory flags which are stored in DynamoDB.

1. mkdirs was creating dir markers without the auth bit,
   forcing needless scans on newly created directories and
   files subsequently added; it was only with the first listStatus call
   on that directory that the dir would be marked as authoritative -even
   though it would be complete already.

2. listStatus(path) would reset the authoritative status bit of all
   child directories even if they were already marked as authoritative.

Issue #2 is possibly the most expensive, as any treewalk using listStatus
(e.g globfiles) would clear the auth bit for all child directories before
listing them. And this would happen every single time...
essentially you weren't getting authoritative directory listings.

For the curious, that the major bug was actually found during testing
-we'd all missed it during reviews.

A lesson there: the better the tests the fewer the bugs.

Maybe also: something obvious and significant can get by code reviews.
