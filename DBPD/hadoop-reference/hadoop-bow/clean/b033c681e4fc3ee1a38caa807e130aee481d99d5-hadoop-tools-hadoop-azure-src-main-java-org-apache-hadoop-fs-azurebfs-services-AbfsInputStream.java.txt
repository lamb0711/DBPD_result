Contributed by Jeetesh Mangwani.

This add the ability to track the end-to-end performance of ADLS Gen 2 REST APIs by measuring latency in the Hadoop ABFS driver.
The latency information is sent back to the ADLS Gen 2 REST API endpoints in the subsequent requests.

-    try {
+    AbfsPerfTracker tracker = client.getAbfsPerfTracker();
+    try (AbfsPerfInfo perfInfo = new AbfsPerfInfo(tracker, "readRemote", "read")) {
+      perfInfo.registerResult(op.getResult()).registerSuccess(true);
