Move the loading to deployUnbonded (where they are required) and add a safety check when a new DT is requested

+import com.google.common.base.Preconditions;

-    loadAWSCredentials();
+    loadAWSCredentials();
-
+    Preconditions.checkNotNull(
+        awsCredentials, "No AWS credentials to use for a delegation token");
