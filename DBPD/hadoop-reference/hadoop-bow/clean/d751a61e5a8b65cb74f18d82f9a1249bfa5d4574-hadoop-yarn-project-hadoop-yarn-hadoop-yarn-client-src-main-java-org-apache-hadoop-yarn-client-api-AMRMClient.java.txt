-   * Requests made via <code>addContainerRequest</code> are sent to the 
-   * <code>ResourceManager</code>. New containers assigned to the master are 
-   * retrieved. Status of completed containers and node health updates are 
-   * also retrieved.
-   * This also doubles up as a heartbeat to the ResourceManager and must be 
-   * made periodically.
-   * The call may not always return any new allocations of containers.
-   * App should not make concurrent allocate requests. May cause request loss.

+   * the RM could end up giving it a lot of new allocated containers.
