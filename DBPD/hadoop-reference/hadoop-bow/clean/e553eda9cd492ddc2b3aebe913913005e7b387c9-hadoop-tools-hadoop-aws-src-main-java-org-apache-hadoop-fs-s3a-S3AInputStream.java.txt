HADOOP-16767 Handle non-IO exceptions in reopen()

Contributed by Sergei Poganshev.

Catches Exception instead of IOException in closeStream() 
and so handle exceptions such as SdkClientException by 
aborting the wrapped stream. This will increase resilience
to failures, as any which occuring during stream closure
will be caught. Furthermore, because the
underlying HTTP connection is aborted, rather than closed,
it will not be recycled to cause problems on subsequent
operations.
