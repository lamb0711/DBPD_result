HADOOP-16384: S3A: Avoid inconsistencies between DDB and S3.

Contributed by Steve Loughran

Contains

- HADOOP-16397. Hadoop S3Guard Prune command to support a -tombstone option.
- HADOOP-16406. ITestDynamoDBMetadataStore.testProvisionTable times out intermittently

This patch doesn't fix the underlying problem but it

* changes some tests to clean up better
* does a lot more in logging operations in against DDB, if enabled
* adds an entry point to dump the state of the metastore and s3 tables (precursor to fsck)
* adds a purge entry point to help clean up after a test run has got a store into a mess
* s3guard prune command adds -tombstone option to only clear tombstones

The outcome is that tests should pass consistently and if problems occur we have better diagnostics.
