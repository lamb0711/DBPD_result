git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/trunk@1498720 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68

+   * @return true if filesystem supports symlinks
-   * The specification of this method matches that of  
-   * {@link FileContext#getLinkTarget(Path)};
+   * Partially resolves the path. This is used during symlink resolution in
+   * {@link FSLinkResolver}, and differs from the similarly named method
+   * {@link FileContext#getLinkTarget(Path)}.
