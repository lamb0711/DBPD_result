YARN-10259. Fix reservation logic in Multi Node Placement.

Reviewed by Wangda Tan.

-    // Considering multi-node scheduling, its better to iterate through
-    // all candidates and stop once we get atleast one good node to allocate
-    // where reservation was made earlier. In normal case, there is only one
-    // node and hence there wont be any impact after this change.

+    // Irrespective of Single / Multi Node Placement, the allocate from
+    // Reserved Container has to happen only for the single node which
+    // CapacityScheduler#allocateFromReservedContainer invokes with.
+    // Else In Multi Node Placement, there won't be any Allocation or
+    // Reserve of new containers when there is a RESERVED container on
+    // a node which is full.
