HADOOP-12780. During WASB atomic rename handle crash when one directory has been renamed but not file under it. Contributed by Madhumita Chakraborty.

+   * Checks whether an explicit file/folder exists.
+   * This is used by redo of atomic rename.
+   * There was a bug(apache jira HADOOP-12780) during atomic rename if
+   * process crashes after an inner directory has been renamed but still
+   * there are file under that directory to be renamed then after the
+   * process comes again it tries to redo the renames. It checks whether
+   * the directory exists or not by calling filesystem.exist.
+   * But filesystem.Exists will treat that directory as implicit directory
+   * and return true as file exists under that directory. So It will try
+   * try to rename that directory and will fail as the corresponding blob
+   * does not exist. So this method explicitly checks for the blob.
