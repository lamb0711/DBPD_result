+   * Once a path has been returned for a resource, that path is safe to use for
+   * the lifetime of the application that corresponds to the provided
+   * ApplicationId.

+   * <p>
+   * Additionally, a name for the resource should be specified. A fragment will
+   * be added to the path with the desired name if the desired name is different
+   * than the name of the provided path from the shared cache. This ensures that
+   * if the returned path is used to create a LocalResource, then the symlink
+   * created during YARN localization will match the name specified.
