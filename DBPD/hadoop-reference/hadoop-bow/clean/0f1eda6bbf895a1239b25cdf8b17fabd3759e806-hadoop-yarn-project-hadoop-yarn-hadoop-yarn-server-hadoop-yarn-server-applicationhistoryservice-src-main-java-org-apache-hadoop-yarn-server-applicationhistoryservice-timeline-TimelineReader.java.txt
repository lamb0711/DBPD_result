+   * This method retrieves a list of entity information, {@link TimelineEntity},
+   * sorted by the starting timestamp for the entity, descending. The starting
+   * timestamp of an entity is a timestamp specified by the client. If it is not
+   * explicitly specified, it will be chosen by the store to be the earliest
+   * timestamp of the events received in the first put for the entity.
+   * @param fromId
+   *          If fromId is not null, retrieve entities earlier than and
+   *          including the specified ID. If no start time is found for the
+   *          specified ID, an empty list of entities will be returned. The
+   *          windowEnd parameter will take precedence if the start time of this
+   *          entity falls later than windowEnd.
+   * @param fromTs
+   *          If fromTs is not null, ignore entities that were inserted into the
+   *          store after the given timestamp. The entity's insert timestamp
+   *          used for this comparison is the store's system time when the first
+   *          put for the entity was received (not the entity's start time).
