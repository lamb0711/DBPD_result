+   * Exposes a stream of namesystem events. Only events occurring after the
+   * stream is created are available.
+   * See {@link org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DFSInotifyEventInputStream}
+   * for information on stream usage.
+   * See {@link org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.inotify.Event}
+   * for information on the available events.
+   * <p/>
+   * Inotify users may want to tune the following HDFS parameters to
+   * ensure that enough extra HDFS edits are saved to support inotify clients
+   * that fall behind the current state of the namespace while reading events.
+   * The default parameter values should generally be reasonable. If edits are
+   * deleted before their corresponding events can be read, clients will see a
+   * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.inotify.MissingEventsException} on
+   * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DFSInotifyEventInputStream} method calls.
+   *
+   * It should generally be sufficient to tune these parameters:
+   * dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained
+   * dfs.namenode.max.extra.edits.segments.retained
+   *
+   * Parameters that affect the number of created segments and the number of
+   * edits that are considered necessary, i.e. do not count towards the
+   * dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained quota):
+   * dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period
+   * dfs.namenode.checkpoint.txns
+   * dfs.namenode.num.checkpoints.retained
+   * dfs.ha.log-roll.period
+   * <p/>
+   * It is recommended that local journaling be configured
+   * (dfs.namenode.edits.dir) for inotify (in addition to a shared journal)
+   * so that edit transfers from the shared journal can be avoided.
+   *
+   * @throws IOException If there was an error obtaining the stream.
