-   * Do a zero-copy read with the current block reader.
+   * Get a ClientMmap object for this BlockReader.
-   * We assume that the calling code has done bounds checking, and won't ask 
-   * us for more bytes than are supposed to be visible (or are in the file).
-   *
-   * @param buffers       The zero-copy buffers object.
-   * @param blockPos      Position in the current block to start reading at.
-   * @param toRead        The number of bytes to read from the block.
-   * 
-   * @return              true if the read was done, false otherwise.
+   * @return              The ClientMmap object, or null if mmap is not
+   *                      supported.
