(cherry picked from commit e4f928cf9cb2a0d57131e4b7960f47a8dac7940c)

- * the operation was successful, if not an exception reporting reason for a
- * failure.
+ * newly generated applicationId and its owner.
+ * The response contains application's home sub-cluster as it is stored in the
+ * {@code FederationApplicationHomeSubClusterStore}. If a mapping for the
+ * application already existed, the {@code SubClusterId} in this response will
+ * return the existing mapping which might be different from that in the
+ * {@code AddApplicationHomeSubClusterRequest}.
