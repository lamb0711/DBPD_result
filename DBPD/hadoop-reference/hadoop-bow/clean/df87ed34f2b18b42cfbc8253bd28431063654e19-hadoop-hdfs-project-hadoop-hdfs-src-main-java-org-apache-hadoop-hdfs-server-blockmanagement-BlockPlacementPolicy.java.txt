-   * Verify that the block is replicated on at least minRacks different racks
-   * if there is more than minRacks rack in the system.
+   * Verify if the block's placement meets requirement of placement policy,
+   * i.e. replicas are placed on no less than minRacks racks in the system.
-   * @param minRacks number of racks the block should be replicated to
-   * @return the difference between the required and the actual number of racks
-   * the block is replicated to.
+   * @param numOfReplicas replica number of file to be verified
+   * @return the result of verification
