YARN-7437. Rename PlacementSet and SchedulingPlacementSet. (Wangda Tan via kkaranasos)

-import java.util.Iterator;
- * <p>
- * PlacementSet is the central place that decide the order of node to fit
- * asks by application.
- * </p>
+ * A group of nodes which can be allocated by scheduler.
- * <p>
- * Also, PlacementSet can cache results (for example, ordered list) for
- * better performance.
- * </p>
+ * It will have following part:
- * <p>
- * PlacementSet can depend on one or more other PlacementSets.
- * </p>
+ * 1) A map of nodes which can be schedule-able.
+ * 2) Version of the node set, version should be updated if any node added or
+ *    removed from the node set. This will be used by
+ *    {@link AppPlacementAllocator} or other class to check if it's required to
+ *    invalidate local caches, etc.
+ * 3) Node partition of the candidate set.
