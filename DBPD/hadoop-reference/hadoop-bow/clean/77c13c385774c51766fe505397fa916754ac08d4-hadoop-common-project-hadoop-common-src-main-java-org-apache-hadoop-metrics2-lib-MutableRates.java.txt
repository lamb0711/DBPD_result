HADOOP-13782. Make MutableRates metrics thread-local write, aggregate-on-read. Contributed by Erik Krogen.

+ *
+ * This class synchronizes all accesses to the metrics it
+ * contains, so it should not be used in situations where
+ * there is high contention on the metrics.
+ * {@link MutableRatesWithAggregation} is preferable in that
+ * situation.
