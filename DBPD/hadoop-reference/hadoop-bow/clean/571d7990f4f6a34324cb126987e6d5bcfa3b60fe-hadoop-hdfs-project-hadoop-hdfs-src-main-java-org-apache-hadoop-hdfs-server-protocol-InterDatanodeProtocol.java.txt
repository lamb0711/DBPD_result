+   * Until version 9, this class InterDatanodeProtocol served as both
+   * the interface to the DN AND the RPC protocol used to communicate with the 
+   * DN.
+   * 
+   * Post version 6L (release 23 of Hadoop), the protocol is implemented in
+   * {@literal ../protocolR23Compatible/InterDatanodeWireProtocol}
+   * 
+   * This class is used by both the DN to insulate from the protocol 
+   * serialization.
+   * 
+   * If you are adding/changing DN's interface then you need to 
+   * change both this class and ALSO
+   * {@link InterDatanodeWireProtocol}
+   * These changes need to be done in a compatible fashion as described in 
+   * {@link ClientNamenodeWireProtocol}
+   * 
+   * The log of historical changes can be retrieved from the svn).
