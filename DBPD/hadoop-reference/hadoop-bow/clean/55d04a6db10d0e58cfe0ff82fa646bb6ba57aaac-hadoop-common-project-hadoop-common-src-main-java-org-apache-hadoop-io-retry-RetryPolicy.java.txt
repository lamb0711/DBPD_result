HADOOP-15275. Incorrect javadoc for return type of RetryPolicy#shouldRetry

Signed-off-by: Akira Ajisaka <aajisaka@apache.org>

-   * @return <code>true</code> if the method should be retried,
-   *         <code>false</code> if the method should not be retried but
-   *         shouldn't fail with an exception (only for void methods)
+   * @return {@link RetryAction} with {@code RetryDecision.FAIL} if the method
+   *          should not be retried, {@code RetryDecision.RETRY} if the method
+   *          should be retried or {@code RetryDecision.FAILOVER_AND_RETRY}
+   *          if failover has to be performed before retry.
