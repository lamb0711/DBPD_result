HADOOP-16665. Filesystems to be closed if they failed during initialize().

Contributed by Steve Loughran.

This FileSystem instantiation so if an IOException or RuntimeException is
raised in the invocation of FileSystem.initialize() then a best-effort
attempt is made to close the FS instance; exceptions raised that there
are swallowed.

The S3AFileSystem is also modified to do its own cleanup if an
IOException is raised during its initialize() process, it being the
FS we know has the "potential" to leak threads, especially in
extension points (e.g AWS Authenticators) which spawn threads.
