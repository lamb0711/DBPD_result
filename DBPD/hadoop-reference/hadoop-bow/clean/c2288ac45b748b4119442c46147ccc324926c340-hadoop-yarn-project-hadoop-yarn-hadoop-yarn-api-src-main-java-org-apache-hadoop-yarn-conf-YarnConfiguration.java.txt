YARN-8448. AM HTTPS Support for AM communication with RMWeb proxy. (Contributed by Robert Kanter)

+   * Specifies what the RM does regarding HTTPS enforcement for communication
+   * with AM Web Servers, as well as generating and providing certificates.
+   * Possible values are:
+   * <ul>
+   *   <li>NONE - the RM will do nothing special.</li>
+   *   <li>LENIENT - the RM will generate and provide a keystore and truststore
+   *   to the AM, which it is free to use for HTTPS in its tracking URL web
+   *   server.  The RM proxy will still allow HTTP connections to AMs that opt
+   *   not to use HTTPS.</li>
+   *   <li>STRICT - this is the same as LENIENT, except that the RM proxy will
+   *   only allow HTTPS connections to AMs; HTTP connections will be blocked
+   *   and result in a warning page to the user.</li>
+   * </ul>
