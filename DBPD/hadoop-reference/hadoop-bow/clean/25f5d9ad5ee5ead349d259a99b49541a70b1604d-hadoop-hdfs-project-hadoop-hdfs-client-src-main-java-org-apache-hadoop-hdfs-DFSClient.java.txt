HDFS-11687. Add new public encryption APIs required by Hive. (lei)

Change-Id: I4a23a00de63ad18022312ceb1f306a87d032d07c

-   * Note (see HDFS-11689):
-   * Not to throw exception in this method since it would break hive.
-   * Hive accesses this method and assumes no exception would be thrown.
-   * Hive should not access DFSClient since it is InterfaceAudience.Private.
-   * Deprecated annotation is added to trigger build warning at hive side.
-   * Request has been made to Hive to remove access to DFSClient.
-  @Deprecated
