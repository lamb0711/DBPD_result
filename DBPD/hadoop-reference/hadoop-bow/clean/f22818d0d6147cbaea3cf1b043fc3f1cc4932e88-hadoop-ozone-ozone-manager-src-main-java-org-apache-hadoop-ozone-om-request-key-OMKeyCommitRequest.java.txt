HDDS-1820. Fix numKeys metrics in OM HA. (#1116)


+
+      // As when we commit the key, then it is visible in ozone, so we should
+      // increment here.
+      // As key also can have multiple versions, we need to increment keys
+      // only if version is 0. Currently we have not complete support of
+      // versioning of keys. So, this can be revisited later.
+
+      if (omKeyInfo.getKeyLocationVersions().size() == 1) {
+        omMetrics.incNumKeys();
+      }
