HDFS-8887. Expose storage type and storage ID in BlockLocation.

+   * This API has been deprecated since the NameNode now tracks datanode
+   * storages separately. Storage IDs can be gotten from {@link
+   * BlockLocation#getStorageIds()}, which are functionally equivalent to
+   * the volume IDs returned here (although a String rather than a byte[]).
