+ * Stream that permits positional reading.
+ *
+ * Implementations are required to implement thread-safe operations; this may
+ * be supported by concurrent access to the data, or by using a synchronization
+ * mechanism to serialize access.
+ *
+ * Not all implementations meet this requirement. Those that do not cannot
+ * be used as a backing store for some applications, such as Apache HBase.
+ *
+ * Independent of whether or not they are thread safe, some implementations
+ * may make the intermediate state of the system, specifically the position
+ * obtained in {@code Seekable.getPos()} visible.
