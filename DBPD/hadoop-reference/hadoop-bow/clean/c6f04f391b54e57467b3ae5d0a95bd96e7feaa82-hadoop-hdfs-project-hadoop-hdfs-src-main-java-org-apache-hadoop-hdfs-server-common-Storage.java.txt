HDFS-7291. Persist in-memory replicas with appropriate unbuffered copy API on POSIX and Windows. Contributed by Xiaoyu Yao.

-   * large files. TheFileUtils#copyLarge function from apache-commons-io library
-   * can be used to achieve this with an internal memory buffer but is less
-   * efficient than the native unbuffered APIs such as sendfile() in Linux and
-   * CopyFileEx() in Windows wrapped in {@link NativeIO#copyFileUnbuffered}.
+   * large files.

+   * We can't use FileUtils#copyFile from apache-commons-io because it
+   * is a buffered IO based on FileChannel#transferFrom, which uses MmapByteBuffer
+   * internally.
