-/**************************************************
- * DatanodeDescriptor tracks stats on a given DataNode, such as
- * available storage capacity, last update time, etc., and maintains a
- * set of blocks stored on the datanode.

- * This data structure is internal to the namenode. It is *not* sent
- * over-the-wire to the Client or the Datanodes. Neither is it stored
- * persistently in the fsImage.
