HADOOP-16058. S3A tests to include Terasort.

Contributed by Steve Loughran.

This includes
 - HADOOP-15890. Some S3A committer tests don't match ITest* pattern; don't run in maven
 - MAPREDUCE-7090. BigMapOutput example doesn't work with paths off cluster fs
 - MAPREDUCE-7091. Terasort on S3A to switch to new committers
 - MAPREDUCE-7092. MR examples to work better against cloud stores

-    
-    FileSystem fs = FileSystem.get(getConf());
+    if (bigMapInput == null || outputPath == null) {
+      // report usage and exit
+      usage();
+      // this stops IDES warning about unset local variables.
+      return -1;
+    }
+
-    if (fs.exists(outputPath)) {
-      fs.delete(outputPath, true);
-    }
+    outputPath.getFileSystem(jobConf).delete(outputPath, true);
-      createBigMapInputFile(jobConf, fs, bigMapInput, fileSizeInMB);
+      createBigMapInputFile(jobConf,
+          bigMapInput.getFileSystem(jobConf),
+          bigMapInput,
+          fileSizeInMB);
