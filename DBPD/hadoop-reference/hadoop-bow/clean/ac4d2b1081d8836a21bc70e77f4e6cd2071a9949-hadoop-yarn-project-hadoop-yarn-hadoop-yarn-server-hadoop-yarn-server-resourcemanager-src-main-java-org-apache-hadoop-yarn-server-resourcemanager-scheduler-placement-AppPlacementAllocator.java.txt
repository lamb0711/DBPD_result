YARN-7437. Rename PlacementSet and SchedulingPlacementSet. (Wangda Tan via kkaranasos)

- * Comparing to {@link PlacementSet}, this also maintains
- * pending ResourceRequests:
- * - When new ResourceRequest(s) added to scheduler, or,
- * - Or new container allocated, scheduler can notify corresponding
- * PlacementSet.
+ * This class has the following functionality:
+ * 1) Keeps track of pending resource requests when following events happen:
+ * - New ResourceRequests are added to scheduler.
+ * - New containers get allocated.
+ *
+ * 2) Determines the order that the nodes given in the {@link CandidateNodeSet}
+ * will be used for allocating containers.
- * Different set of resource requests (E.g., resource requests with the
- * same schedulerKey) can have one instance of PlacementSet, each PlacementSet
- * can have different ways to order nodes depends on requests.
+ * And different set of resource requests (E.g., resource requests with the
+ * same schedulerKey) can have one instance of AppPlacementAllocator, each
+ * AppPlacementAllocator can have different ways to order nodes depends on
+ * requests.
