-   * enough space. For now we set it to be the default block size set
-   * in the server side configuration, which is not ideal because the
-   * default block size should be a client-size configuration. 
-   * A better solution is to include in the header the estimated block size,
-   * i.e. either the actual block size or the default block size.
+   * enough space. Newer clients pass the expected block size to the DataNode.
+   * For older clients we just use the server-side default block size.
