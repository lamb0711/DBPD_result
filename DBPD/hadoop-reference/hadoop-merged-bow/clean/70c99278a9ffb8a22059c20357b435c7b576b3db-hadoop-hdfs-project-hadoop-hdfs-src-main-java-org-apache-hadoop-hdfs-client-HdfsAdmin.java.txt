HDFS-6780. Batch the encryption zones listing API. (wang)

git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/branches/fs-encryption@1615189 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68

-   * Return a list of all {@link EncryptionZone}s in the HDFS hierarchy which
-   * are visible to the caller. If the caller is an HDFS superuser,
-   * then the key name of each encryption zone will also be provided.
-   *
-   * @throws IOException if there was a general IO exception
-   *
-   * @return List<EncryptionZone> the list of Encryption Zones that the caller has
-   * access to.
+   * Returns a RemoteIterator which can be used to list the encryption zones
+   * in HDFS. For large numbers of encryption zones, the iterator will fetch
+   * the list of zones in a number of small batches.
+   * <p/>
+   * Since the list is fetched in batches, it does not represent a
+   * consistent snapshot of the entire list of encryption zones.
+   * <p/>
+   * This method can only be called by HDFS superusers.
