HADOOP-11847 Enhance raw coder allowing to read least required inputs in decoding. Contributed by Kai Zheng

+   * How to prepare for inputs:
+   * 1. Create an array containing parity units + data units;
+   * 2. Set null in the array locations specified via erasedIndexes to indicate
+   *    they're erased and no data are to read from;
+   * 3. Set null in the array locations for extra redundant items, as they're
+   *    not necessary to read when decoding. For example in RS-6-3, if only 1
+   *    unit is really erased, then we have 2 extra items as redundant. They can
+   *    be set as null to indicate no data will be used from them.
+   *
+   * For an example using RS (6, 3), assuming sources (d0, d1, d2, d3, d4, d5)
+   * and parities (p0, p1, p2), d2 being erased. We can and may want to use only
+   * 6 units like (d1, d3, d4, d5, p0, p2) to recover d2. We will have:
+   *     inputs = [p0, null(p1), p2, null(d0), d1, null(d2), d3, d4, d5]
+   *     erasedIndexes = [5] // index of d2 into inputs array
+   *     outputs = [a-writable-buffer]
+   *
