HADOOP-16109. Parquet reading S3AFileSystem causes EOF

Nobody gets seek right. No matter how many times they think they have.

Reproducible test from: Dave Christianson
Fixed seek() logic: Steve Loughran

-          && diff <= forwardSeekLimit;
+          && diff < forwardSeekLimit;
+          LOG.debug("Now at {}: bytes remaining in current request: {}",
+              pos, remainingInCurrentRequest());
