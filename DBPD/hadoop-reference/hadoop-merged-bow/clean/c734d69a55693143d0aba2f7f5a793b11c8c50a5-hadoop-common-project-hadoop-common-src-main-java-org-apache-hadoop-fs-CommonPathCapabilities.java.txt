HADOOP-16898. Batch listing of multiple directories via an (unstable) interface

Contributed by Steve Loughran.

This moves the new API of HDFS-13616 into a interface which is implemented by
HDFS RPC filesystem client (not WebHDFS or any other connector)

This new interface, BatchListingOperations, is in hadoop-common,
so applications do not need to be compiled with HDFS on the classpath.
They must cast the FS into the interface.

instanceof can probe the client for having the new interface -the patch
also adds a new path capability to probe for this.

The FileSystem implementation is cut; tests updated as appropriate.

All new interfaces/classes/constants are marked as @unstable.
