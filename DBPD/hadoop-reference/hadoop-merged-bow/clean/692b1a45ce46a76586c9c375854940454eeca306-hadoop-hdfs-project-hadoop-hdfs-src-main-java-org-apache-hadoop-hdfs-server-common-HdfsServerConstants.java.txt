HDFS-9134. Move LEASE_{SOFTLIMIT,HARDLIMIT}_PERIOD constants from HdfsServerConstants to HdfsConstants. Contributed by Mingliang Liu.

-   * For a HDFS client to write to a file, a lease is granted; During the lease
-   * period, no other client can write to the file. The writing client can
-   * periodically renew the lease. When the file is closed, the lease is
-   * revoked. The lease duration is bound by this soft limit and a
-   * {@link HdfsServerConstants#LEASE_HARDLIMIT_PERIOD hard limit}. Until the
-   * soft limit expires, the writer has sole write access to the file. If the
-   * soft limit expires and the client fails to close the file or renew the
-   * lease, another client can preempt the lease.
+   * Please see {@link HdfsConstants#LEASE_SOFTLIMIT_PERIOD} and
+   * {@link HdfsConstants#LEASE_HARDLIMIT_PERIOD} for more information.
