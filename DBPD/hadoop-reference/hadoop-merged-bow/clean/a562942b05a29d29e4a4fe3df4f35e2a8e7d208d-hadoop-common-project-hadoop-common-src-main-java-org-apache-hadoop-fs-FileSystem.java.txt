HADOOP-16759. FileSystem Javadocs to list what breaks on API changes

Followup to the main openFile().withStatus() patch.
It turns out that this broke the hive builds, which
was not well appreciated.

This patch lists places to review in the hadoop codebase,
and external projects where changes are likely to cause problems.

+ * <b>Important note for developers</b>
+ *
+ * If you're making changes here to the public API or protected methods,
+ * you must review the following subclasses and make sure that
+ * they are filtering/passing through new methods as appropriate.
+ *
+ * {@link FilterFileSystem}: methods are passed through.
+ * {@link ChecksumFileSystem}: checksums are created and
+ * verified.
+ * {@code TestHarFileSystem} will need its {@code MustNotImplement}
+ * interface updated.
+ *
+ * There are some external places your changes will break things.
+ * Do co-ordinate changes here.
+ *
+ * HBase: HBoss
+ * Hive: HiveShim23
+ * {@code shims/0.23/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/shims/Hadoop23Shims.java}
