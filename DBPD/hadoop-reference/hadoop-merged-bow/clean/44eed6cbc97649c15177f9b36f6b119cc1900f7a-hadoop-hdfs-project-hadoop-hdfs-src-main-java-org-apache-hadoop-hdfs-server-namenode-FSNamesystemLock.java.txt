HDFS-7615. Remove longReadLock. Contributed by Kihwal Lee.

-  /**
-   * When locking the FSNS for a read that may take a long time, we take this
-   * lock before taking the regular FSNS read lock. All writers also take this
-   * lock before taking the FSNS write lock. Regular (short) readers do not
-   * take this lock at all, instead relying solely on the synchronization of the
-   * regular FSNS lock.
-   * 
-   * This scheme ensures that:
-   * 1) In the case of normal (fast) ops, readers proceed concurrently and
-   *    writers are not starved.
-   * 2) In the case of long read ops, short reads are allowed to proceed
-   *    concurrently during the duration of the long read.
-   * 
-   * See HDFS-5064 for more context.
