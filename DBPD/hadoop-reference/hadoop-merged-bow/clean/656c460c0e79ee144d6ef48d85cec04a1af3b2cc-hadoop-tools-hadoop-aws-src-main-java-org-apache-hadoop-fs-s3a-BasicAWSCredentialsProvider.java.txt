+/**
+ * BasicAWSCredentialsProvider supports static configuration of access key ID
+ * and secret access key for use with the AWS SDK.
+ *
+ * Please note that users may reference this class name from configuration
+ * property fs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider.  Therefore, changing the class name
+ * would be a backward-incompatible change.
