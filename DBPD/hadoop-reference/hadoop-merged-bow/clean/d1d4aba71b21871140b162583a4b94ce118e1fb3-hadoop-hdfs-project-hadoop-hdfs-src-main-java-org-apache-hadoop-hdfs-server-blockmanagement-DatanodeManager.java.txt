HDFS-11224. Lifeline message should be ignored for dead nodes (Contributed by Vinayakumar B)

-    if (nodeinfo == null) {
-      // This is null if the DataNode has not yet registered.  We expect this
-      // will never happen, because the DataNode has logic to prevent sending
-      // lifeline messages until after initial registration is successful.
+    if (nodeinfo == null || !nodeinfo.isRegistered()) {
+      // This can happen if the lifeline message comes when DataNode is either
+      // not registered at all or its marked dead at NameNode and expectes
+      // re-registration. Ignore lifeline messages without registration.
