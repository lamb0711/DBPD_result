YARN-6571. Fix JavaDoc issues in SchedulingPolicy
(Contributed by Weiwei Yang via Daniel Templeton)

+/**
+ * The SchedulingPolicy is used by the fair scheduler mainly to determine
+ * what a queue's fair share and steady fair share should be as well as
+ * calculating available headroom. This determines how resources can be
+ * shared between running applications within a queue.
+ * <p>
+ * Every queue has a policy, including parents and children. If a child
+ * queue doesn't specify one, it inherits the parent's policy.
+ * The policy for a child queue must be compatible with the policy of
+ * the parent queue; there are some combinations that aren't allowed.
+ * See {@link SchedulingPolicy#isChildPolicyAllowed(SchedulingPolicy)}.
+ * The policy for a queue is specified by setting property
+ * <i>schedulingPolicy</i> in the fair scheduler configuration file.
+ * The default policy is {@link FairSharePolicy} if not specified.
