HADOOP-16785. Improve wasb and abfs resilience on double close() calls.

This hardens the wasb and abfs output streams' resilience to being invoked
in/after close().

wasb:
  Explicity raise IOEs on operations invoked after close,
  rather than implicitly raise NPEs.
  This ensures that invocations which catch and swallow IOEs will perform as
  expected.

abfs:
  When rethrowing an IOException in the close() call, explicitly wrap it
  with a new instance of the same subclass.
  This is needed to handle failures in try-with-resources clauses, where
  any exception in closed() is added as a suppressed exception to the one
  thrown in the try {} clause
  *and you cannot attach the same exception to itself*
