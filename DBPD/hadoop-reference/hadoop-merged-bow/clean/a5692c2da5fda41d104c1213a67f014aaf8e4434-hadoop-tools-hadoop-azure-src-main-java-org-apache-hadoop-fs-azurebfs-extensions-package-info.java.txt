+/**
+ * This package is for extension points under ABFS;
+ * There are no stability guarantees as these extension points are
+ * deep inside the ABFS implementation code.
+ *
+ * Note, however: this is how the ABFS client integrates with
+ * authorization services and other aspects of Azure's infrastructure.
+ * Do not change these APIs without good reason or detailed discussion.
