- * Performs two types of scanning:
- * <li> Gets block files from the data directories and reconciles the
- * difference between the blocks on the disk and in memory.</li>
- * <li> Scans the data directories for block files under a block pool
- * and verifies that the files are not corrupt</li>
+ * Scans the block files under a block pool and verifies that the
+ * files are not corrupt.
+        // If the block exists, the exception may due to a race with write:
+        // The BlockSender got an old block path in rbw. BlockReceiver removed
+        // the rbw block from rbw to finalized but BlockSender tried to open the
+        // file before BlockReceiver updated the VolumeMap. The state of the
+        // block can be changed again now, so ignore this error here. If there
+        // is a block really deleted by mistake, DirectoryScan should catch it.
