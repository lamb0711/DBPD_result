HADOOP-16580. Disable retry of FailoverOnNetworkExceptionRetry in case of AccessControlException. Contributed by Adam Antal

+ * The methods of UnreliableInterface could throw exceptions in a
+ * predefined way. It is currently used for testing {@link RetryPolicy}
+ * and {@link FailoverProxyProvider} classes, but can be potentially used
+ * to test any class's behaviour where an underlying interface or class
+ * may throw exceptions.
+ *
+ * Some methods may be annotated with the {@link Idempotent} annotation.
+ * In order to test those some methods of UnreliableInterface are annotated,
+ * but they are not actually Idempotent functions.
