MAPREDUCE-6703. Add flag to allow MapReduce AM to request for OPPORTUNISTIC containers. Contributed by Arun Suresh

+  /**
+   * Number of OPPORTUNISTIC Containers per 100 containers that will be
+   * requested by the MRAppMaster. The Default value is 0, which implies all
+   * maps will be guaranteed. A value of 100 means all maps will be requested
+   * as opportunistic. For any other value say 'x', the FIRST 'x' maps
+   * requested by the AM will be opportunistic. If the total number of maps
+   * for the job is less than 'x', then ALL maps will be OPPORTUNISTIC
