-  public static final long TS_MULTIPLIER = 1000L;
+  public static final long TS_MULTIPLIER = 1000000L;
-   * returns a timestamp multiplied with TS_MULTIPLIER and last few digits of
-   * application id
+   * Returns a timestamp multiplied with TS_MULTIPLIER and last few digits of

-   * than a 1000 concurrent apps are running in one flow run AND write to same
-   * column at the same time, then say appId of 1001 will overlap with appId of
-   * 001 and there may be collisions for that flow run's specific column.
