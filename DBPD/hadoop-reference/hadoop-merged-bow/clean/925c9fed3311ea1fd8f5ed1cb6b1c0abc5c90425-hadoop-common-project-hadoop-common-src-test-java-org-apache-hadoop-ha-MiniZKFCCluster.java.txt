HADOOP-10668. Addendum patch to fix TestZKFailoverController. Contributed by Ming Ma.

+   * This is based on the state of ZKFC, not the state of HA service.
+   * There could be difference between the two. For example,

+   * transition to HAServiceState.INITIALIZING and remain in that state
+   * until the service becomes healthy.
