+   * Set node label expression of this resource request. Now only support
+   * specifying a single node label. In the future we will support more complex
+   * node label expression specification like AND(&&), OR(||), etc.
-   * Examples: 
-   * - GPU && LARGE_MEM, ask for node has label GPU and LARGE_MEM together
-   * - "" (empty) means ask for node doesn't have label on it, this is default
-   *   behavior
+   * Any please note that node label expression now can only take effect when
+   * the resource request has resourceName = ANY
-   * @param nodelabelExpression node-label-expression of this ResourceRequest
+   * @param nodelabelExpression
+   *          node-label-expression of this ResourceRequest
