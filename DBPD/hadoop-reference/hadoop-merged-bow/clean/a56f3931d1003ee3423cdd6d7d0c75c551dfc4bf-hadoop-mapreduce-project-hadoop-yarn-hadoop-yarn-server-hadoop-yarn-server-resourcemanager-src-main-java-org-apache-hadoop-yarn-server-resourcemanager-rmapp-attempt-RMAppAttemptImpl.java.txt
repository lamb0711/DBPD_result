+         * In the case when the AM dies, the trackingUrl is left pointing to the AM's
+         * URL, which shows up in the scheduler UI as a broken link. Setting it here
+         * to empty string will prevent any link from being displayed.
+         * NOTE: don't set trackingUrl to 'null'. That will cause null-pointer exceptions
+         * in the generated proto code.
