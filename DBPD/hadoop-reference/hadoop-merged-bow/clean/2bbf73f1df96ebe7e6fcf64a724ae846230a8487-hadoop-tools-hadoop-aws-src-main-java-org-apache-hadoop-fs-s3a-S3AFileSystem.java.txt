HADOOP-16645. S3A Delegation Token extension point to use StoreContext.

Contributed by Steve Loughran.

This is part of the ongoing refactoring of the S3A codebase, with the
delegation token support (HADOOP-14556) no longer given a direct reference
to the owning S3AFileSystem. Instead it gets a StoreContext and a new
interface, DelegationOperations, to access those operations offered by S3AFS
which are specifically needed by the DT bindings.

The sole operation needed is listAWSPolicyRules(), which is used to allow
S3A FS and the S3Guard metastore to return the AWS policy rules needed to
access their specific services/buckets/tables, allowing the AssumedRole
delegation token to be locked down.

As further restructuring takes place, that interface's implementation
can be moved to wherever the new home for those operations ends up.

Although it changes the API of an extension point, that feature (S3
Delegation Tokens) has not shipped; backwards compatibility is not a
problem except for anyone who has implemented DT support against trunk.
To those developers: sorry.
