YARN-4605. Spelling mistake in the help message of "yarn applicationattempt" command. Contributed by Weiwei Yang.

-          "List application attempts for aplication.");
+          "List application attempts for application.");
-    sysout.println("Updating priority of an aplication " + applicationId);
+    sysout.println("Updating priority of an application " + applicationId);
