+ * Note that the blocking APIs ensure the RPC calls to <code>NodeManager</code>
+ * are executed immediately, and the responses are received before these APIs
+ * return. However, when {@link #startContainer} or {@link #stopContainer}
+ * returns, <code>NodeManager</code> may still need some time to either start
+ * or stop the container because of its asynchronous implementation. Therefore,
+ * {@link #getContainerStatus} is likely to return a transit container status
+ * if it is executed immediately after {@link #startContainer} or
+ * {@link #stopContainer}.
