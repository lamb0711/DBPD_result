HADOOP-16346. Stabilize S3A OpenSSL support.

Introduces `openssl` as an option for `fs.s3a.ssl.channel.mode`.
The new option is documented and marked as experimental.

For details on how to use this, consult the peformance document
in the s3a documentation.

This patch is the successor to HADOOP-16050 "S3A SSL connections
should use OpenSSL" -which was reverted because of
incompatibilities between the wildfly OpenSSL client and the AWS
HTTPS servers (HADOOP-16347). With the Wildfly release moved up
to 1.0.7.Final (HADOOP-16405) everything should now work.

Related issues:

* HADOOP-15669. ABFS: Improve HTTPS Performance
* HADOOP-16050: S3A SSL connections should use OpenSSL
* HADOOP-16371: Option to disable GCM for SSL connections when running on Java 8
* HADOOP-16405: Upgrade Wildfly Openssl version to 1.0.7.Final
