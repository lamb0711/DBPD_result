HADOOP-17060. Clarify listStatus and getFileStatus behaviors inconsistent in the case of ViewFs implementation for isDirectory. Contributed by Uma Maheswara Rao G.


-   * Note that this operation is not atomic for a large directory.
-   * The entries of a directory may be fetched from NameNode multiple times.
-   * It only guarantees that  each name occurs once if a directory
-   * undergoes changes between the calls.

+   * If any of the the immediate children of the given path f is a symlink, the
+   * returned FileStatus object of that children would be represented as a
+   * symlink. It will not be resolved to the target path and will not get the
+   * target path FileStatus object. The target path will be available via
+   * getSymlink on that children's FileStatus object. Since it represents as
+   * symlink, isDirectory on that children's FileStatus will return false.
+   *
+   * If you want to get the FileStatus of target path for that children, you may
+   * want to use GetFileStatus API with that children's symlink path. Please see
+   * {@link DistributedFileSystem#getFileStatus(Path f)}
+   *
+   * If the given path is a symlink, the path will be resolved to a target path
+   * and it will get the resolved path's FileStatus object. It will not be
+   * represented as a symlink and isDirectory API returns true if the resolved
+   * path is a directory, false otherwise.
