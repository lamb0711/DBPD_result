HADOOP-14630 Contract Tests to verify create, mkdirs and rename under a file is forbidden

Contributed by Steve Loughran.

Not all stores do complete validation here; in particular the S3A
Connector does not: checking up the entire directory tree to see if a path matches
is a file significantly slows things down.

This check does take place in S3A mkdirs(), which walks backwards up the list of
parent paths until it finds a directory (success) or a file (failure).
In practice production applications invariably create destination directories
before writing 1+ file into them -restricting check purely to the mkdirs()
call deliver significant speed up while implicitly including the checks.
