+   * If the operation which is being checked will be taking the FSNS lock, it's
+   * advisable to check the operation category both immediately before and after
+   * taking the lock. This is because clients rely on the StandbyException
+   * thrown by this method in order to trigger client failover, and if a client
+   * first tries to contact the Standby NN, it could block for a long time if
+   * the Standby is holding the lock for a while, e.g. when performing a
+   * checkpoint. See HDFS-4591 for more details.
