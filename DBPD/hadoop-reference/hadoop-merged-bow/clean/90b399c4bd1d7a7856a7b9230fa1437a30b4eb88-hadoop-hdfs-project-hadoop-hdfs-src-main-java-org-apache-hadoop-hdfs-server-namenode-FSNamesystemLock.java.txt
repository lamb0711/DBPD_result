+   * When locking the FSNS for a read that may take a long time, we take this
+   * lock before taking the regular FSNS read lock. All writers also take this
+   * lock before taking the FSNS write lock. Regular (short) readers do not
+   * take this lock at all, instead relying solely on the synchronization of the
+   * regular FSNS lock.
+   * 
+   * This scheme ensures that:
+   * 1) In the case of normal (fast) ops, readers proceed concurrently and
+   *    writers are not starved.
+   * 2) In the case of long read ops, short reads are allowed to proceed
+   *    concurrently during the duration of the long read.
+   * 
+   * See HDFS-5064 for more context.
