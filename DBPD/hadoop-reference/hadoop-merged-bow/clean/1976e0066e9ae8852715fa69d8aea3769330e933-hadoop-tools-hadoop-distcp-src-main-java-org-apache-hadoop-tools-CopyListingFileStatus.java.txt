HADOOP-15209. DistCp to eliminate needless deletion of files under already-deleted directories.
Contributed by Steve Loughran.

+ * This is the datastructure persisted in the sequence files generated
+ * in the CopyCommitter when deleting files.
+ * Any tool working with these generated files needs to be aware of an
+ * important stability guarantee: there is none; expect it to change
+ * across minor Hadoop releases without any support for reading the files of
+ * different versions.
+ * Tools parsing the listings must be built and tested against the point
+ * release of Hadoop which they intend to support.
