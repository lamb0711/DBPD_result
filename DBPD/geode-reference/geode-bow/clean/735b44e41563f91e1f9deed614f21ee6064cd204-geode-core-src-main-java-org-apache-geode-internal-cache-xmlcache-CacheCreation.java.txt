GEODE-4575: remove getAnyInstance call in CacheCreation (#1406)

Changed getInternalDistributedSystem to throw an exception if it is called.
It appears that this method is never used on a CacheCreation but because this
class implements the InternalCache interface it has to have an implementation.

* fixed a place the GatewaySender was asking for the
InternalDistributedSystem during xml parsing

-    return InternalDistributedSystem.getAnyInstance();
+    throw new UnsupportedOperationException(LocalizedStrings.SHOULDNT_INVOKE.toLocalizedString());
