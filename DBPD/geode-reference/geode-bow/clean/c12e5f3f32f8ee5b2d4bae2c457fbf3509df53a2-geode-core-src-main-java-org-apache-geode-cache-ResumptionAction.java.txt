GEODE-6380: Getting rid of nextOrindal pattern

We had some mutable statics that used a static nextOrdinal++ pattern.
This code worked, but it wasn't really necessary so removing the pattern
in favor of completely immutable static state.

-import org.apache.geode.annotations.internal.MakeNotStatic;
-  public static final ResumptionAction NONE = new ResumptionAction("NONE");
+  public static final ResumptionAction NONE = new ResumptionAction("NONE", 0);
-  public static final ResumptionAction REINITIALIZE = new ResumptionAction("REINITIALIZE");
+  public static final ResumptionAction REINITIALIZE = new ResumptionAction("REINITIALIZE", 1);
-  // The 4 declarations below are necessary for serialization
-  public final byte ordinal = nextOrdinal++;
-
-  @MakeNotStatic
-  private static byte nextOrdinal = 0;
+  public final byte ordinal;
-  private ResumptionAction(String name) {
+  private ResumptionAction(String name, int ordinal) {
+    this.ordinal = (byte) ordinal;
