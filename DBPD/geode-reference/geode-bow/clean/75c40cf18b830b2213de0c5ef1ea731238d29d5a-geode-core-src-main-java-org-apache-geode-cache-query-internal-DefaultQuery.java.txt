GEODE-5686: Remove LocalizedStrings

Fixing problems found by lgtm.com

There were a lot of logging calls that were improperly converted from
(MessageFormatString, Argument, Exception) to a form that treated the
Exception as part of the String.format() call.

There were a number of errors in format strings or number of arguments.
MessageFormat was more forgiving about this than String.format().

There were a few dangling MessageFormat specs that needed to be
converted to String.format() specs.

This closes #2757

-            String.format("Region not found:  %s", regionPath));
+            String.format("Region not found: %s", regionPath));
-                prs.get(0).getName(), prs.get(1).getName()));
+                prs.get(0).getName()));
-                  "A query on a Partitioned Region ( %s ) may not reference any other region except Co-located Partitioned Region. PR region (1) is not collocated with other PR region in the query.",
+                  "A query on a Partitioned Region ( %s ) may not reference any other region except Co-located Partitioned Region. PR region %s is not collocated with other PR region in the query.",
