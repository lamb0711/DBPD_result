GEODE-6404: work around possible sync issue with computeIfAbsent (#3196)

* GEODE-6404: work around possible synchronization issue with computeIfAbsent

  *  Tries to do the get() outside of a lock before computing
  *  Added jmh test
  *  Local benchmarking showed that although jdk 11 fixes the contention issue that
       performing the get was faster than the retrieve mechanism of computeIfAbsent

+import org.apache.geode.internal.util.JavaWorkarounds;
-    return proxyIdConnections.computeIfAbsent(proxyID, key -> new ServerConnectionCollection());
+    return JavaWorkarounds.computeIfAbsent(proxyIdConnections, proxyID,
+        key -> new ServerConnectionCollection());
