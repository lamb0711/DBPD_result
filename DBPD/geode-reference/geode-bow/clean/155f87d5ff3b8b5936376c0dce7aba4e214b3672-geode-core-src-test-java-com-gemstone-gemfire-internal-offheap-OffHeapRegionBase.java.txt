GEODE-1017: change off-memory from compaction to defragmentation

 Replaced references of compaction with `defragmentation`, to better
 convey the intent behind the operation.

-      // TODO: currently the compact will product slabs bigger than the max slab size
-      // (see the todo comment on compact() in FreeListManager).
+      // TODO: currently the defragment will produce slabs bigger than the max slab size
+      // (see the todo comment on defragment() in FreeListManager).
