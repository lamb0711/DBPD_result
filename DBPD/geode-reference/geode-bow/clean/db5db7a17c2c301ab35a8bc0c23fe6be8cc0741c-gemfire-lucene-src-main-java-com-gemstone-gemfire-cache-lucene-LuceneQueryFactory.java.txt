Removing ResultType from LuceneQueryFactory

ResultType is not necessary since there is no performance gain to be had
by not including the key or score, and the presence of the value is
controlled by setProjectionFields.

-  public enum ResultType {
-    /**
-     *  Query results only contain value, which is the default setting.
-     *  If field projection is specified, use projected fields' values instead of whole domain object
-     */
-    VALUE,
-    
-    /**
-     * Query results contain score
-     */
-    SCORE,
-    
-    /**
-     * Query results contain key
-     */
-    KEY
-  };
-
-   * set weather to include SCORE, KEY in result
-   * 
-   * @param resultTypes
-   * @return itself
-   */
-  LuceneQueryFactory setResultTypes(ResultType... resultTypes);
