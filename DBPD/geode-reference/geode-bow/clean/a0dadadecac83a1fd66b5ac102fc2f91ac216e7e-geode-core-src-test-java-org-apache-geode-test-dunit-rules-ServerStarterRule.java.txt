GEODE-2989: Improve mechanism for scanning the classpath to find gfsh commands

(cherry picked from commit 2f50aef)

+  /**
+   * By default, the ServerStartRule dynamically changes the "user.dir" system property to point to
+   * a temporary folder. The Path API caches the first value of "user.dir" that it sees, and this
+   * can result in a stale cached value of "user.dir" which points to a directory that no longer
+   * exists, causing later tests to fail. By passing in the real value of "user.dir", we avoid these
+   * problems.
