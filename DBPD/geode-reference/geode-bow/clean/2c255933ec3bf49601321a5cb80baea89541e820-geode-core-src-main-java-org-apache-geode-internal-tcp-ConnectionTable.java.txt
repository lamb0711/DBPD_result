GEODE-3286: Failing to cleanup connections from ConnectionTable

In previous fix, we were checking "if thread is stopped then add

connection to reciver list if connection is not closed or thread is not
stopped.

Added unit for it.

-        if (!connection.isSocketClosed() || connection.stopped) {
+        if (!(connection.isSocketClosed() || connection.isReceiverStopped())) {
