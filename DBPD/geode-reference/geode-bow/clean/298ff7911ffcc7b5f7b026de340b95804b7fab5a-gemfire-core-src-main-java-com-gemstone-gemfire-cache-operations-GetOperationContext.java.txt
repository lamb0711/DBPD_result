GEODE-86: add a way to get the deserialized value to KeyValueOperationContext

KeyValueOperationContext now has a getDeserializedValue method that can be used
to get the operation value as a deserialized object.
The javadocs on getValue now explain that the result may be a serialized blob.
Unit test coverage has been added for PutOperationContext and GetOperationContextImpl
which are subclasses of KeyValueOperationContext.

+   *         or {@link #getDeserializedValue()}.
-    return this.value;
+    if (super.getSerializedValue() != null) {
+      return null;
+    } else {
+      return super.getValue();
+    }
