GEODE-3583: Marking static variables final that are never modified

To help reduce the number of mutable statics to look through, adding
final to all of the statics that are not actually mutated outside of a
static initializer.

This change *only* consists of adding final to these variables.

-  private static long ENCODED_BIT = 1L;
+  private static final long ENCODED_BIT = 1L;
-  static long SERIALIZED_BIT = 2L;
+  static final long SERIALIZED_BIT = 2L;
-  static long COMPRESSED_BIT = 4L;
+  static final long COMPRESSED_BIT = 4L;
-  private static long LONG_BIT = 8L;
+  private static final long LONG_BIT = 8L;
-  private static long SIZE_MASK = 0x70L;
+  private static final long SIZE_MASK = 0x70L;
-  private static int SIZE_SHIFT = 4;
+  private static final int SIZE_SHIFT = 4;
