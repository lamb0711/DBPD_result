GEODE-8240: Member Identifier Future Versions

Inability of member identifiers to hold future versions caused 
problems in rolling upgrades. Now member identifiers hang on 
to a VersionOrdinal which is a base type for Version "enum".
-    otherMembers.removeIf(member -> Version.GEODE_1_5_0.compareTo(member.getVersionObject()) > 0);
+    otherMembers
+        .removeIf(member -> Version.GEODE_1_5_0.compareTo(member.getVersionOrdinalObject()) > 0);
