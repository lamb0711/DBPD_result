fixed GEODE-824 : Failure from JGroupsMessengerJUnitTest.testMulticastTest

AvailablePort wasn't correctly setting up its multicast socket to communicate
with JGroups on Dan's Ubuntu VM.  SocketCreator was picking a Docker address
from his system and the JGroups port was binding to this but AvailablePort
wasn't doing the same thing, and it wasn't attempting to join the multicast
group at all.

-      DatagramSocket socket = null;
+      MulticastSocket socket = null;
+        InetAddress localHost = SocketCreator.getLocalHost();
+        socket.setInterface(localHost);
+        InetAddress mcid = addr==null? DistributionConfig.DEFAULT_MCAST_ADDRESS : addr;
-          addr==null? DistributionConfig.DEFAULT_MCAST_ADDRESS : addr, port);
+          mcid, port);
+        socket.joinGroup(mcid);
