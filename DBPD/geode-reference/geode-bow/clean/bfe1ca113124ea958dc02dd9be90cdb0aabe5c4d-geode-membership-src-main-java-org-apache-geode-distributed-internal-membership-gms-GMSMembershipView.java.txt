GEODE-8240: Member Identifier Future Versions

Inability of member identifiers to hold future versions caused 
problems in rolling upgrades. Now member identifiers hang on 
to a VersionOrdinal which is a base type for Version "enum".
+  /**
+   * GEODE-8240 could cause a coordinator to produce a view with a wrong version during
+   * rolling upgrade. This method lets a view recipient repair the damaged version in
+   * its own member identifier.
+   *
+   * Mutates the version of the member identifier corresponding to memberID in this view.
+   *
+   * Remove this method when version Geode version 1.12.0 is no longer running in the wild.
+   *
+   * @param memberID is the identifier of the member of interest
+   */
+  public void correctWrongVersionIn(final ID memberID) {
+    final ID oldID = getCanonicalID(memberID);
+    if (!oldID.getVersionOrdinalObject().equals(Version.getCurrentVersion())) {
+      // don't remove/add the ID lest we change it's relative position in the list
+      oldID.setVersionObjectForTest(Version.getCurrentVersion());
