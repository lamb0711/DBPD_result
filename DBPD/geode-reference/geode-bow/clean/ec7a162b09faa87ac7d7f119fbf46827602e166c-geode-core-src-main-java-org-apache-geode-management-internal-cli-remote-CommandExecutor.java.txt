* Extracted cluster configuration messages in CommandExecutor to public class fields, for test consumption.
* Extracted several message strings in ModelCommandResult to public class fields, for test consumption
* Serialized necessary AsyncEventQueue configuration classes and updated sanctioned-geode-core-serializables
