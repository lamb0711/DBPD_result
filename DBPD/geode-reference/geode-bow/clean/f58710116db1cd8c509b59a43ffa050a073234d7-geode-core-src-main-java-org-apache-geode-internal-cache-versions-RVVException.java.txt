 GEODE-7085: Ensuring the bitset stays within BIT_SET_WIDTH (#3922)

Ensuring that when we call recordVersion on a RegionVersionHolder,
we appropriately move the bitSet to match the new version we are
recording, rather than trying to expand it. In particular, if new
version is greater than Integer.MAX_VALUE, we can't record than in out
integer indexed bit set.

This change rewrites addBitSetExceptions. The logic is now broken into a
BitSetExceptionIterator, which converts some or all of the bit set into
RVVException objects, and the logic to slide the bit set forward to a
new bitSetVersion.

Adding unit tests that show that large versions cause an
IndexOutOfBounds exception from recordGCVersion. Adding more unit tests
for the internal state of the bitset.
+  /**
+   * Create an exception to represent missing versions

+   * @param previousVersion The previous version before the first missing version
+   * @param nextVersion The next received version after the last missing version
