GEODE-634 CI failure: DistributedMemberDUnitTest.testRolesInAllVMs

Fixed the suspect string and added unit tests.  I also added a new constructor
in NetView and modified tests that were using the full constructor with
empty crashed/left member sets to use it.  That simplified their code a bit.

+      return;
