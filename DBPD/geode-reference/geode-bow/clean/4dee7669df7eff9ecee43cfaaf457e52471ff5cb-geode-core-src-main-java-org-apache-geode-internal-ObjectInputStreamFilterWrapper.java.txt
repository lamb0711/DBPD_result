GEODE-5685: change whitelist and blacklist
-        Collection<String> classNames = service.getSerializationWhitelist();
+        Collection<String> classNames = service.getSerializationAcceptlist();
-          "unable to read sanctionedSerializables.txt to form a serialization white-list", e);
+          "unable to read sanctionedSerializables.txt to form a serialization acceptlist", e);
-     * create a user filter with the serialization whitelist/blacklist. This will be wrapped
-     * by a filter that white-lists sanctioned classes
+     * create a user filter with the serialization acceptlist/denylist. This will be wrapped
+     * by a filter that accept-lists sanctioned classes
-          if (serialClass == null) { // no class to check, so nothing to white-list
+          if (serialClass == null) { // no class to check, so nothing to accept-list
