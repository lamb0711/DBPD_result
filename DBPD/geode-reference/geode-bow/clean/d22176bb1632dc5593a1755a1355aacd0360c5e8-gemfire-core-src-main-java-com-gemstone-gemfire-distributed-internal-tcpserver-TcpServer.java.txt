GEODE-871: Frequient use of executeOnAllServers causes build-up of TIME_WAIT sockets

Modified the fix to not abort the connection if a response wasn't read.
I also propagated this pattern to GMSHealthMonitor so that the "final
check" sockets are quickly released.

-            output.close();
-          // Normal path closes input first, so let's do that here...
-          if (input != null) {
-            try {
-              input.close();
-            } catch (IOException e) {
-              log.warn(
-                "Exception closing input stream", e);
-            }
-          }
-
-          // Closing the ObjectInputStream is supposed to close
-          // the underlying InputStream, but we do it here just for
-          // good measure. Closing a closed socket is a no-op.
-            log.warn(
-                "Exception closing socket", e);
+            // ignore
