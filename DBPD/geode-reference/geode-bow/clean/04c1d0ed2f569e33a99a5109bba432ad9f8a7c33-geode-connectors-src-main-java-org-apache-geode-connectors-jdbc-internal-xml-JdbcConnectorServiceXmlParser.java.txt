GEODE-5935: move jdbc xml mapping to be in a region  (#2739)

The jdbc region-mapping xml element is now jdbc:mapping.
It no longer has a "region" attribute since it is nested in a region.
Creating a jdbc-mapping requires that the region already exists.
The jdbc:mapping element is now nested in a region element instead of the cache element.
The old connector-service element has been completely removed.
Some of the jdbc-mapping gfsh commands now require at least one server to be running.
