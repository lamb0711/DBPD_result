Adding a query method to IndexRepository

This method takes a result collector that receives a gemfire key and
score for each result.

+import org.apache.lucene.search.Query;

+  
+  /**
+   * Query the index index repository, passing the results to the collector
+   * Only the documents with the top scores, up to the limit, will be passed
+   * to the collector, in order of score.
+   * 
+   * @param query
+   * @param limit the maximum number of hits to return
+   * @param collector the class to aggregate the hits
+   * 
+   * @throws IOException
