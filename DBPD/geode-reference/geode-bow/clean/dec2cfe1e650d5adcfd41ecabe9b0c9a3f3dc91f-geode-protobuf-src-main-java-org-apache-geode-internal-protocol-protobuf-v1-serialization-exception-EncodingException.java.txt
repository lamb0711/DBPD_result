GEODE-4377: Don't catch encoding exceptions in OperationHandlers

This adds DecodingException and moves the handling of EncodingException
and this new exception to ProtobufOpsProcessor.

I've also added tests for getAll and putAll to ensure that their
handlers properly process all entries in the presence of a Key or
Entry decoding error.

This closes #1434

- * This indicates an encoding type that we don't know how to handle.
+ * This indicates a Java object that we don't know how to handle.
