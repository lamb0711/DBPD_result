GEODE-190: Fix ReflectionBasedAutoSerializer leak

A weak map value references its key keeping the key from ever being garbage.
The only reason the weak map was added was to allow internal code to get
the AutoSerializableManager given a ReflectionBasedAutoSerializer.
But the map was not really needed since the ReflectionBasedAutoSerializer
has a final field named "manager".
The only problem is that ReflectionBasedAutoSerializer is a public
api and AutoSerializableManager is internal.
This fix adds a getManager method on ReflectionBasedAutoSerializer that returns object
and is javadoc'd for "internal use only". The internal code casts the result to
AutoSerializableManager. This allows the weak map that was causing the memory leak
to be removed.

-  private static final Map<ReflectionBasedAutoSerializer, AutoSerializableManager> instances = new CopyOnWriteWeakHashMap<ReflectionBasedAutoSerializer, AutoSerializableManager>();
-
-    instances.put(owner, result);
-  public static AutoSerializableManager getInstance(ReflectionBasedAutoSerializer owner) {
-    return instances.get(owner);
-  }
