GEODE-4131: Do not reference deployed jars as byte arrays anymore (#1212)

* GEODE-4131: Do not reference deployed jars as byte arrays anymore

- All jars are streamed between locators and servers using the RMIIO library.
- Whenever an upload happens (either deploying jars or importing cluster
  config) we stage the files initially and then proceed with the command.
+   * @param stagedFilePaths list of local files to be deployed
-  public String processCommand(String commandString, Map<String, String> env, byte[][] binaryData) {
+  public String processCommand(String commandString, Map<String, String> env,
+      List<String> stagedFilePaths) {
-    Result result = commandProcessor.executeCommand(commandString, env, binaryData);
+    Result result = commandProcessor.executeCommand(commandString, env, stagedFilePaths);
