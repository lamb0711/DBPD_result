GEODE-7552: Break dependency on Services (#4438)

Rewrote locator installation to use Membership rather than the "hidden"
Services interface.

I rewrote some tests to stop using the internal interfaces of membership
as well, and along the way saw that JGroupsMessenger was maintaining a
collection of old identifiers that was only being consumed by a test & I
removed it.
+import org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.Distribution;
-import org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.membership.gms.Services;
+import org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.membership.gms.api.Membership;
-    gmsLocator.setServices(
-        ((InternalDistributedSystem) ds).getDM().getDistribution().getServices());
+    InternalDistributedSystem ids = (InternalDistributedSystem) ds;
+    Distribution distribution = ids.getDM().getDistribution();
+    gmsLocator.setMembership(distribution.getMembership());
-  public boolean setServices(Services pservices) {
-    return gmsLocator.setServices(pservices);
+  public boolean setMembership(Membership membership) {
+    return gmsLocator.setMembership(membership);
