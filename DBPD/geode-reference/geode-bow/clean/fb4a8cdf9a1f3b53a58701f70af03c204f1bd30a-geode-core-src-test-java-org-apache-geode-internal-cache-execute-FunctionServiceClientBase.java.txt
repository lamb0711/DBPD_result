GEODE-3784: Removing old function timeout test and adding a better one

PRFunctionExecutionTimeOutDUnitTest failed because it had a small
timeout, but the test really messy for what it was testing. Added a
simple test to FunctionServiceBase which I think covers what was trying
to be tested and deleting PRFunctionExecutionTimeOutDUnitTest.

+import org.junit.Assume;
+import org.junit.Ignore;
+
+
+  @Override
+  public void resultCollectorHonorsFunctionTimeout() throws InterruptedException {
+    Assume.assumeTrue("GEODE-3817 - Client side function execution does not honor the timeout",
+        false);
+    super.resultCollectorHonorsFunctionTimeout();
+  }
