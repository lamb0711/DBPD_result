GEODE-489: delegate in getRefCount

Certains subclasses of MemoryBlock do not have a refCount.
But the MemoryBlockNode implementation was always trying to
read a refCount using the memory address of the block.
Instead it should have delegated getRefCount to the MemoryBlock
implementation.

-      return Chunk.getRefCount(getMemoryAddress());
+      return this.block.getRefCount(); // delegate to fix GEODE-489
