GEODE-4566: remove getInstance calls from PartitionMessage (#1411)

* cache is now obtained from DistributionManager
to check if the cache is closed instead of getting
it from GemFireCacheImpl.getInstance.

* setTransactionDisabled is now set without calling getInstance

+    msg.setTransactionDistributed(r.getCache().getTxManager().isDistributed());
