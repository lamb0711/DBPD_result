GEODE-719: Processing errors in cache.xml do not log a warning

- Catch all Errors and RuntimeExceptions while creating a cache and log
an error level message.
- Display the cache.xml contents before trying to initialize the cache
so that the errors have a better context.
- Converted some exception messages to i18n.

-        throw new IllegalStateException("The region " + myName + " was configured to use off heap memory but no off heap memory was configured.");
+        throw new IllegalStateException(LocalizedStrings.
+            LocalRegion_THE_REGION_0_WAS_CONFIGURED_TO_USE_OFF_HEAP_MEMORY_BUT_OFF_HEAP_NOT_CONFIGURED.toLocalizedString(myName));
