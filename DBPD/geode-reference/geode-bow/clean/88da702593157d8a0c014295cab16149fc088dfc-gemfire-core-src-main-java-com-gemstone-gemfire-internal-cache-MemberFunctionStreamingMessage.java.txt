GEODE-542: Send a function response after a CancelException

There was a catch clause of a CancelException that was causing us not to
reply to a function call if a CacheClosedException was thrown from the
function. That caused as hang waiting for replies.

+import com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.execute.FunctionInvocationTargetException;
-      thr = null;
-      if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
-        logger.debug("shutdown caught, abandoning message: {}",exception.getMessage(), exception);
-      }
+      thr = new FunctionInvocationTargetException(exception);
+      stats.endFunctionExecutionWithException(this.functionObject.hasResult());
+      rex = new ReplyException(thr);
+      replyWithException(dm, rex);
