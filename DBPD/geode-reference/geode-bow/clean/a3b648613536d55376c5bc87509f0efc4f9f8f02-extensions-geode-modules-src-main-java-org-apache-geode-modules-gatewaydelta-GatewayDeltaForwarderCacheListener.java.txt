GEODE-5984 Address LGTM recommendations

Addressing minor issues in javadocs and code reported by LooksGoodToMe.

One change that I made wasn't reported by that tool: I removed
two static variables from AcceptorImpl that duplicated variables in
Handshake.

This closes #2780

-        System.out.println(
-            "GatewayDeltaForwarderCacheListener event.getSerializedNewValue().getSerializedValue(): "
-                + event.getSerializedNewValue().getSerializedValue());
-    // System.out.println("GatewayDeltaForwarderCacheListener.afterUpdate: " + event);
