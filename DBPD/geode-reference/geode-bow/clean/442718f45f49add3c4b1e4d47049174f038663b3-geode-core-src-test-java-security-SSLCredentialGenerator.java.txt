GEODE-620 Geode SSL configuration is out of date

In reviewing uses of SSL I found that SocketCreator did not have support for
TLSv1.2 and that one of the test classes had a reference to an RC4-based
cipher suite.

-    props.setProperty("ssl-ciphers", "SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5");
+    props.setProperty("ssl-ciphers", "SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA");
