GEODE-1723 Merge from 82 for performance improvement.

Other improvement:We take lock on key while doing op on BucketRegion.
In that case we notify to other thread only when there is a thread
waiting for it. Modified one condition to log message to reduce garbage.

-    
+  private boolean waiting = false;
+
-  
-  /**Always updated when the monitor is held on this object */
+
+  public void waiting() {
+    waiting = true;
+  }
+
+  public boolean isSomeoneWaiting() {
+    return waiting;
+  }
+
+  /** Always updated when the monitor is held on this object */
-  /**Always checked when the monitor is held on this object */
+  /** Always checked when the monitor is held on this object */
-  
+
+  @Override
-    return "{LockObject="+key+"("+lockedTimeStamp+")}";
+    return "LockObject [key=" + key + ", lockedTimeStamp=" + lockedTimeStamp + ", removed=" + removed + ", waiting=" + waiting + "]";
