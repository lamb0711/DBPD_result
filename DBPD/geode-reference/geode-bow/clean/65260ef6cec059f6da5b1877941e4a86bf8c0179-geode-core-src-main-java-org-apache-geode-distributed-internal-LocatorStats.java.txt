GEODE-7585: Create API for starting a locator in the membership package

Creating a new MembershipLocator and MembershipLocatorBuilder that are used to
create the membership locator. These classes encapsulate the TcpServer,
PrimaryHandler, and GMSLocator that were previously held by InternalLocator.

Getting rid of some intermdiate classes that wrapped the GMSLocator -
NetLocator and GMSLocatorAdapter.

Refactoring the restart logic out of PrimaryHandler. There is now a separate
RestartHandler, and a separate collection that tracks RestartHandlers. Removing
RestartableTcpHandler.

Removing TcpServerFactory.
