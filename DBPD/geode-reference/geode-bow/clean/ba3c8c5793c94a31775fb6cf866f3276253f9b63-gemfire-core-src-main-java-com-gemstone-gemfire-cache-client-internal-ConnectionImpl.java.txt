Now we call shutDownOutput on stream while closing the socket. We have
cache close message, which doesn't have any resposne from server. Because
of that some this message doesn't reach to server while closing the client
connection. Thus Bruce suggested, we should call shutDownOutput on stream while
closing the connection.

-      if (theSocket != null)
+      if (theSocket != null) {
+        theSocket.getOutputStream().flush();
+        theSocket.shutdownOutput();
+      }
