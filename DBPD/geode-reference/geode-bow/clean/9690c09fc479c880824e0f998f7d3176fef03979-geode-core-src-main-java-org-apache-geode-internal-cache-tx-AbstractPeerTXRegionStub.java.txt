GEODE-3679 Forward client member id to other peers in transaction message.

  * Do not forward size request of a bucket region to transaction hosting node.
  * Move the method from LocalRegion to DistributedRegion.
  * Make region in TXRegionStub strong type to avoid some casting in the code.

-  protected final LocalRegion region;
-  public AbstractPeerTXRegionStub(TXStateStub txstate, LocalRegion r) {
+  public AbstractPeerTXRegionStub(TXStateStub txstate) {
-    this.region = r;
