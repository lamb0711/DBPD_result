GEODE-657: Add an abort flag to the FinishBackupMessage

If the prepare phase of a backup fails, it can leave the backup in a
prepared state on several nodes. The FinishBackupMessage should always
be sent to cleanup the backup. Adding an abort flag to
FinishBackupMessage and always sending that message regardless of
failures during the prepare.
