[GEODE-2381] spotless: line break on enum constants.

* Change the style XML file to insert a line break after each constant
  of an enum.
* This commit is just the style file change; spotless will be applied
  next.
* Apply spotless to fix enums and nothing else in this commit.

There may be a better way to do this and allow simple enums to be all on
one line, but this looks better to me.

This closes #368
