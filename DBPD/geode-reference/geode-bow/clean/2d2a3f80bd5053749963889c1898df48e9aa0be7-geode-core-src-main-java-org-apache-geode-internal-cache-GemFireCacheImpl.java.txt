GEODE-7884: server hangs due to IllegalStateException (#4822)

* GEODE-7884: server hangs due to IllegalStateException

Added cancellation check before scheduling an idle-timeout or
ack-wait-threshold timer task.  I had to add a new method to
SystemTimerTask and then noticed there were no tests for SystemTimer, so
I cleaned up that class and added tests.

* adding missing copyright header to new test

* fixing LGTM issues

* reinstating 'continue' when encountering a null timer during a sweep

* addressing Bill's comments

renamed swarm everwhere
made the collection of timers associated with a DistributedSystem into a Set
made timer task variables in Connection volatile
added checks in tasks to cancel themselves if their Connection is closed
-        object -> new SystemTimer(object, true),
+        object -> new SystemTimer((DistributedSystem) object),
