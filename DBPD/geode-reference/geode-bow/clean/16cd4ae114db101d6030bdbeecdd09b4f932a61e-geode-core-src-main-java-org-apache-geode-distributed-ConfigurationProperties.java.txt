GEODE-5830: Remove NONE enum for SSL configuration

The 'NONE' enum constant doesn't work and it's not used, so it's
entirely removed by this commit. Updated documentation and tests.
-   * <U>Options</U>: "all","server","cluster","gateway","web","jmx","none" -- As described
+   * <U>Options</U>: "all","server","cluster","gateway","web","jmx","" -- As described
