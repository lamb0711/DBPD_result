GEODE-4328: Make backup into a task run by a single thread (#1351)


  * The BackupLock had to acquire and release the underlying lock and keep
  * track of who was supposed to be the true owner of the lock due to the fact
  * that the part of backup that acquired the locks was done on a different
  * thread than the one that release the locks. Since the backup task now is
  * completed in a single thread, we can replace it with a ReentrantLock.
-  HashSet<PersistentID> run() throws IOException {
+  HashSet<PersistentID> run() throws IOException, InterruptedException {
-      persistentIds = cache.startBackup(member).prepareForBackup();
+      BackupManager backupManager = cache.startBackup(member);
+      backupManager.startBackup();
+      persistentIds = backupManager.getDiskStoreIdsToBackup();
