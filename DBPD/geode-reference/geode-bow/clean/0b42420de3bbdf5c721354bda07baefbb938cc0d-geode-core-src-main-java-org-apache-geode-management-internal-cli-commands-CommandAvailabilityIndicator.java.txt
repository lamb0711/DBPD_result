GEODE-5951: add a create data-source gfsh command (#2758)

The new "create data-source" command is a replacement for "create jndi-binding". It has fewer options so will be easier for users to understand. Once it is done parsing its options it ends up using the same internal code as "create jndi-binding" to create the actual data-source.
