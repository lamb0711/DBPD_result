GEODE-3799: Move backups towards a pluggable architecture (#1109)


  * This effort decouples the definition of files to be backed up
    from the destination of the backup. It will allow for the
    development of different, pluggable, strategies for conducting
    backups, such as compressed archive files of backups or backup
    to cloud providers.

  * A new BackupDestination interface is provided and the existing
    logic for saving a backup to the filesystem has been moved into
    an implementation of this interface, FileSystemBackupDestination.
    During a backup, all files are copied to a temporary directory
    and added to a definition of the backup. This definition is then
    used to send the files to their ultimate destination. In the
    current case of moving the files to a specified location on the
    filesystem, this is implemented by moving the files from the
    temporary location to the target backup directory.
