GEODE-3240: Refactor LuceneSerializer to have only a toDocuments method

Refactoring our internal LuceneSerializer API to have a method called
toDocuments, which matches the API we want to have when we make this
class public.

-
-  @Override
-  public LuceneIndexFactory setLuceneSerializer(LuceneSerializer luceneSerializer) {
-    return this;
-  }
