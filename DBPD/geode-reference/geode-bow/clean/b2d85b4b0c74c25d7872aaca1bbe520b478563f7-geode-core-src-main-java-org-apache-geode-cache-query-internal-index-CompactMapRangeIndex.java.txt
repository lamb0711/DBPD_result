GEODE-1967: Old keys are removed from removedKeyValuesEntries

	* Old keys are removed from removedKeyValuesEntries after the mapping is removed from Compact map range indexes.
	* New tests were added to handle various scenarios of old keys being destroyed and then inserted again.

-     for (Map.Entry<?, ?> keyValue : removedKeyValueEntries) {
+    Iterator<Entry> iterator = removedKeyValueEntries.iterator();
+     while (iterator.hasNext()) {
+       Entry keyValue = iterator.next();
-        CompactRangeIndex rg = (CompactRangeIndex) this.mapKeyToValueIndex.get(keyValue.getKey());
-        rg.removeMapping(keyValue.getValue(), entry);
+         CompactRangeIndex rg = (CompactRangeIndex) this.mapKeyToValueIndex.get(keyValue.getKey());
+         rg.removeMapping(keyValue.getValue(), entry);
+         iterator.remove();
