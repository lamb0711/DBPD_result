GEODE-1687: Added null check for CQs proxy connection.

When a connection relating to CQ is established or dropped, CqStatusListner is invoked
to indicate connection/subscription status. This allows application to handle if all

in CqServiceImpl.invokeCqsConnected when CQ is executed using the Bridge loader
interface (old way of client-server connection)...
