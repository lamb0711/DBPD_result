GEODE-1072: Removing HDFS related code

Removing all HDFS and EvictionCriteria created code. This code will be
reinstated on a branch to be cleaned up and merged as a separate module.

-  /** boolean to indicate that this operation should be optimized by not fetching from HDFS*/
-  private transient boolean fetchFromHDFS = true;
-  
-  /** boolean to indicate that the RegionEntry for this event was loaded from HDFS*/
-  private transient boolean loadedFromHDFS= false;
-  
-  private transient boolean isCustomEviction = false;
-  
-  public final boolean isCustomEviction() {
-    return this.isCustomEviction;
-  }
-  
-  public final void setCustomEviction(boolean customEvict) {
-    this.isCustomEviction = customEvict;
-  }
-  
-  public final boolean isFetchFromHDFS() {
-    return fetchFromHDFS;
-  }
-
-  public final void setFetchFromHDFS(boolean fetchFromHDFS) {
-    this.fetchFromHDFS = fetchFromHDFS;
-  }
-
-  public final boolean isLoadedFromHDFS() {
-    return loadedFromHDFS;
-  }
-
-  public final void setLoadedFromHDFS(boolean loadedFromHDFS) {
-    this.loadedFromHDFS = loadedFromHDFS;
-  }
