GEODE-1558, GEODE-1609: Fixing failures due to rebalancing buckets during lucene index updates

There are two failures we're fixing here:
1) Calling repository.create for create events was leaving duplicate events in the
index because when a bucket fails over, the event is dispatched again on the new primary.
Using the isPossibleDuplicate flag did not work because it was not consistently set to
true for duplicate events. Changed the code to call repository.update even for create events

2) The async event queue was repeatedly dispatching the same events event after
a bucket moved to another node. We changed the async event queue code to filter out
events for buckets that are no longer present on this dispatching member.

Cleaning up the rebalancing test and adding new tests to make these scenarios
more reproducable.

This closes #176
