GEODE-7586: Fix NPE in RemoteGfManagerAgentTest (#4492)

If the thread invoking disconnect gets enough cpu cycles before the
thread invoking removeMember, then it tries to invoke listApplications
with null for system.

The fix sets the system so the field is non-null which also simulates a
real run more closely as well.
+  @VisibleForTesting
+  void setDSConnection(InternalDistributedSystem system) {
+    this.system = system;
+  }
