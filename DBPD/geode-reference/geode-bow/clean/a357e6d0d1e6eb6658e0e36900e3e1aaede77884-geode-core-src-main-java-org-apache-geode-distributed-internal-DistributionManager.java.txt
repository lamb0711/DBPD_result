GEODE-7556: remove membership dependencies on geode-core exeptions (#4502)

* GEODE-7556: remove membership dependencies on geode-core exeptions

Removed use of geode-core exceptions from membership. DistributionImpl now converts membership exceptions into geode-core exceptions where necessary.

Except for MembershipClosedException the new membership exceptions are all checked exceptions. This let me isolate where the exceptions are used and ensure that they're changed into appropriate geode-core exceptions.

MemberShunnedException is now in the membership module instead of the TcpConduit module. It, too, is a checked exception.

CancelCriterion is also removed from use in the membership module. The Stopper in Services.java doesn't need to be a CancelCriterion to function properly.

Several tests had to be modified to handle our stress-test environement.

* use checkCancelled method

+  /**

+   * @see MembershipTestHook
+   */
+  void registerTestHook(MembershipTestHook mth);
+
+  /**
+   * remove a test hook previously registered with the manager
+   */
+  void unregisterTestHook(MembershipTestHook mth);
