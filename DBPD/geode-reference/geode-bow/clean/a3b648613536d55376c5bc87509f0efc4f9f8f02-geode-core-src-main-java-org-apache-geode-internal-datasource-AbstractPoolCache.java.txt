GEODE-5984 Address LGTM recommendations

Addressing minor issues in javadocs and code reported by LooksGoodToMe.

One change that I made wasn't reported by that tool: I removed
two static variables from AcceptorImpl that duplicated variables in
Handshake.

This closes #2780

-  /**
-   * Authenticates the username and password for the database connection.
-   *
-   * @param user The username for the database connection
-   * @param pass The password for the database connection
-   *
-   *        public abstract void checkCredentials(String user, String pass)
-   */
-  /**
-   * @return ???
-   */
