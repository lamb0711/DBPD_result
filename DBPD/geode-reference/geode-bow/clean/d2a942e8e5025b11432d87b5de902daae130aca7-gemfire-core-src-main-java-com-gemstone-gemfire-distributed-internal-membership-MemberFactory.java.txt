jgroups source is now removed from asf branch GEODE-77 and is a downloaded dependency.  Able to start/stop a locator and a server via gfsh but there is no HA or authentication in the membership system.

-import com.gemstone.gemfire.distributed.internal.membership.jgroup.JGroupMemberFactory;

-  private static final MemberServices services = new JGroupMemberFactory();

-      boolean splitBrainEnabled, boolean canBeCoordinator, MemberAttributes payload) {
-    return services.newNetMember(i, p, splitBrainEnabled, canBeCoordinator, payload);
+      boolean splitBrainEnabled, boolean canBeCoordinator, short version, MemberAttributes payload) {
+    return services.newNetMember(i, p, splitBrainEnabled, canBeCoordinator, payload, version);
