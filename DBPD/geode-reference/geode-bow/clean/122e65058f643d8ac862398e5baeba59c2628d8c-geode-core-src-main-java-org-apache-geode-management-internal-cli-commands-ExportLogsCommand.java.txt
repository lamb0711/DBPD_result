GEODE-2725: export logs now honors --dir when connected via JMX, with
respect to the manager filesystem.

* Absolute Paths are better.  Test class inheritance is cumbersome.

* Removed --dir usage from ExportLogsDUnitTests:
startAndEndDateCanIncludeLogs and
testExportWithStartAndEndDateTimeFiltering; these tests expected logs
to appear in the locator working directory and the --dir option was
not actually being used.

* Usage of LocalLocatorStarterRules reverted in
ExportLogsIntegrationTest as locator working directory access is
required.

* this closes #438

Corrected mismatched merging of strings against offline help golden file.
