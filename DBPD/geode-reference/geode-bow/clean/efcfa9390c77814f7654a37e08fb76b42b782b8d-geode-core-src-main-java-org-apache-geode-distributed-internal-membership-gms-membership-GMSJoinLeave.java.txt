Revert "GEODE-6244 Healthy member kicked out by sick member"

There are unit test failures caused by what I thought were innocuous changes

This reverts commit f4b8cf2f8dbcb98b541b24238b50b4066ff136a8.

-      installView(new NetView(view, view.getViewId()));
+      installView(view);
-      newView.makeImmutable();
