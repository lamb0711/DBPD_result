GEODE-6626: Separate CacheServer and GatewayReceiver

Introduce new interfaces and then have GatewayReceiverServer extend
CacheServerImpl to override behavior.

-  @SuppressWarnings("deprecation")
+  public GatewayReceiverCreation(Cache cache, GatewayReceiver gatewayReceiver) {
+    this(cache, gatewayReceiver.getStartPort(), gatewayReceiver.getEndPort(),
+        gatewayReceiver.getMaximumTimeBetweenPings(), gatewayReceiver.getSocketBufferSize(),
+        gatewayReceiver.getBindAddress(), gatewayReceiver.getGatewayTransportFilters(),
+        gatewayReceiver.getHostnameForSenders(), gatewayReceiver.isManualStart());
+  }
+
-      // add a cache server and set its port to random port. See defect 45630 for more details.
-      receiver = ((CacheCreation) this.cache).addCacheServer(true);
+      // add a cache server and set its port to random port
+      receiver = cache.addCacheServer();
