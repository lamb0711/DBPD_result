GEODE-3530: refactor to not use CliCommandTestBase (#2125)

Use the GfshCommandRule and ClusterStarterRule to replace the
CliCommandTestBase in order to make the test less flaky.

* extract rebalance tests to new class

* extract region membership from MBean tests

* extract tests for region membership from MBeans and Function context to
their own class and add more tests

* fix serialization filter and remove eviction rules

* finish extracting tests from GemFireDataCommandsDUnit
