GEODE_368: CI failure in HARQueueNewImplDUnitTest.testConcurrentGIIAndDispatch

removed an old assertion that is no longer valid and rewrote the code to
allow for the possibility of a null entry in the queue.

This commit also includes renaming of one of the old BugXXX unit test classes
that I'm currently working on to have a name that matches what it is testing.

-    Object event = null;
-      event = this.region.get(counter);
-      event = (event instanceof HAEventWrapper) ? this.haContainer
-          .get(event) : event;
-      //Since this method is invoked in a readlock , the entry in HARegion
-      // cannot be null
-      if (event == null) {
-        Assert.assertTrue(this.destroyInProgress,
-            "Got event null when queue was not being destroyed");
+      Object eventOrWrapper = this.region.get(counter);
+      Object event;
+      if (eventOrWrapper instanceof HAEventWrapper) {
+        event = haContainer.get(eventOrWrapper);
+        if (event == null) {
+          event = ((HAEventWrapper)eventOrWrapper).getClientUpdateMessage();
+        }
+      } else {
+        event = eventOrWrapper;
-      batch.add(event);
+      if (event != null) {
+        batch.add(event);
+      }
