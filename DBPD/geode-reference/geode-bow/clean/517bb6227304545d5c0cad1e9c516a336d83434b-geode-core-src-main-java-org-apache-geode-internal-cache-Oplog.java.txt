GEODE-2472 changes are made to ensure byte array is completely flushed to oplog channel.

The Oplog and OverflowOplog flush(OplogFile olf, ByteBuffer b1, ByteBuffer b2) method doesn't check the results of the channel.write() call.

It could so happen partial byte array is written to the channel. The check is added to make sure the bytes are completely written to the file channel.

-        long flushed = olf.channel.write(this.bbArray);
+        long flushed = 0;
+        do {
+          flushed += olf.channel.write(this.bbArray);
+        } while (b2.hasRemaining());
