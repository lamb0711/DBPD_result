GEODE-17: WIP integrating Pulse with new security

- After refactoring some Pulse test code, various tests are broken as
  they seem to depend on prior test state.

-          LOGGER.info("Exception Occured while updating cluster data : " + e.getMessage());
+          LOGGER.info("Exception Occurred while updating cluster data : " + e.getMessage());
-          LOGGER.info("InterruptedException Occured : " + e.getMessage());
+          LOGGER.info("InterruptedException Occurred : " + e.getMessage());
