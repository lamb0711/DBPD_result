GEODE-135: Added UnclosableInputStream for SAX parser

This closes #12

In order to block the parser from closing the stream, we wrap the
InputStream in a filter, i.e., UnclosableInputStream, whose close()
function does nothing.

+    /**
+     * The API doc
+     * http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/org/xml/sax/InputSource.html for
+     * the SAX InputSource says: "... standard processing of both byte and
+     * character streams is to close them on as part of end-of-parse cleanup, so
+     * applications should not attempt to re-use such streams after they have
+     * been handed to a parser."
