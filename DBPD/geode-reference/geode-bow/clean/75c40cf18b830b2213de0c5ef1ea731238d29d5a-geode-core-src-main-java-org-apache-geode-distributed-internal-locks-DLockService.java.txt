GEODE-5686: Remove LocalizedStrings

Fixing problems found by lgtm.com

There were a lot of logging calls that were improperly converted from
(MessageFormatString, Argument, Exception) to a form that treated the
Exception as part of the String.format() call.

There were a number of errors in format strings or number of arguments.
MessageFormat was more forgiving about this than String.format().

There were a few dangling MessageFormat specs that needed to be
converted to String.format() specs.

This closes #2757

-    return String.format("%s  has been destroyed", this);
+    return String.format("%s has been destroyed", this);
-                    String.format("%s  attempted to reenter non-reentrant lock %s",
+                    String.format("%s attempted to reenter non-reentrant lock %s",
-                  "Attempting to unlock  %s  :  %s , but this thread does not own the lock.",
+                  "Attempting to unlock %s : %s , but this thread does not own the lock.",
-                    "Attempting to unlock  %s  :  %s , but this thread does not own the lock.  %s",
+                    "Attempting to unlock %s : %s , but this thread does not own the lock. %s",
