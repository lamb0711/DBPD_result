change more string commands to have CommandFunction support (#5184)

* CommandFunction now supports getrange, setrange, bitcount, bitop, bitpos, getbit, setbit, incrbyfloat, mget, and strlen.

Added integration test coverage for untested string commands.

-  private final int SET = 1;
+  private static final int SET = 1;
-  private final int NOT_SET = 0;
+  private static final int NOT_SET = 0;
-  private final int VALUE_INDEX = 2;
+  private static final int VALUE_INDEX = 2;
