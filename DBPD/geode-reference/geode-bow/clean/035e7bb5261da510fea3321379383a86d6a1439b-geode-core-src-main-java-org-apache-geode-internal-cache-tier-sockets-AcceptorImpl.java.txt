GEM-2031: Removing the use of shutdownNow from AcceptorImpl pools

Using shutdownNow interrupts the threads in these pools. These threads
may be doing IO on sockets, so shutdownNow will interrupt the threads
and potentially cause issues shutting down.

-      this.pool.shutdownNow();
+      this.pool.shutdown();
-    this.clientQueueInitPool.shutdownNow();
-    this.hsPool.shutdownNow();
+    this.clientQueueInitPool.shutdown();
+    this.hsPool.shutdown();
