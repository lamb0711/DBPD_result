GEODE-6559: PdxInstance.getObject() is using class from older jar in case of Reconnect (#3353)

- TypeRegistry needs to be cleared during reconnect
- Fix ServerStarterRule to not blindly disable some PDX attributes on server start
- Currently configuring PDX, via gfsh, does not work correctly in
  conjunction with this rule.
