GEODE-346: Split into UnitTests and IntegrationTests

Extract IntegrationTests from AutoBalancerJUnitTest and move some
common code to setup and teardown methods. Fix GEODE-346 by making
teardown wait for HostStatSampler statThread to terminate.

Isolate test with sleep to its own test class and document. The next
step should involve refactoring of AutoBalancer to break dependencies
to allow for correct mocking.

Add Awaitility version 1.6.5 to dependencies (GEODE-217).

Add check to see if HostStatSampler statThread is alive or not.

-    return statThread.isAlive();
+    synchronized (HostStatSampler.class) {
+      return statThread != null && statThread.isAlive();
+    }
