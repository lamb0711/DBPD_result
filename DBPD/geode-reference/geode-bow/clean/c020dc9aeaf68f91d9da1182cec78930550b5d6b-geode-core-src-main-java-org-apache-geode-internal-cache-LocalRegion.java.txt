GEODE-4957: fix race in concurrent create on region (#1836)

Reverted the revert of GEODE-4957.
Only cleanup if basicPut created a new region entry and its value at the end is still REMOVED_PHASE1

-  void cleanUpOnIncompleteOp(EntryEventImpl event, RegionEntry regionEntry) {
-    // Ok to remove entry as index has not been modified yet by the operation
-    this.entries.removeEntry(event.getKey(), regionEntry, false);
-  }
