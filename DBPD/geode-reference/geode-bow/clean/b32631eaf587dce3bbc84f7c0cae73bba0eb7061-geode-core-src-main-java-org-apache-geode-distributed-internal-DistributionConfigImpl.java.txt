GEODE-6503: Moving redis into a separate module

* Moving all of the geode redis apapter code to the geode-redis module
* Moving the redis specific dependencies (netty and geo) to geode-redis
* Adding a GeodeRedisService to initialize the redis server

The geode distribution will still include redis, and gfsh start server
will still include redis on it's classpath. However, consumers of
the geode-core maven module will no longer get the redis module and its
dependencies unless they explicitly also depend on geode-redis.

This closes #3284

-import org.apache.geode.redis.GeodeRedisServer;
