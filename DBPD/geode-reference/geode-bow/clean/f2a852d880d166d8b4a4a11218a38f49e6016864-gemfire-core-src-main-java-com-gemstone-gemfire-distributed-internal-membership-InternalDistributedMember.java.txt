Modifying the fix for handling old client IDs

The previous fix for handling old client identifiers left the IDs always
thinking that the client was running version GFE_82.  The new fix makes
the client defer to its encapsulated InternalDistributedMember identifier
to determine the client's version and handles deserialization of the
encapsulated pre-GFE_90 identifier in InternalDistributedMember.fromData().

This fix has the added benefit of reducing the size of client identifiers.

+import java.io.EOFException;
-      netMbr.readAdditionalData(in);
+      try {
+        netMbr.readAdditionalData(in);
+      } catch (EOFException e) {
+        // nope - it's from a pre-GEODE client or WAN site
+      }
+  
+  public final void setVersionObjectForTest(Version v) {
+    this.version = v.ordinal();
+    this.versionObj = v;
+    netMbr.setVersion(v);
+  }
