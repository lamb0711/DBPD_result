GEODE-5925 Server shutdown delays election of new primary bucket owners

Undoing removal of null check when sending profile updates.  The method
that sends profile update messages may return null instead of a reply
processor object so this check is still needed.

-      reply.waitForRepliesUninterruptibly();
+      if (reply != null) {
+        reply.waitForRepliesUninterruptibly();
+      }
