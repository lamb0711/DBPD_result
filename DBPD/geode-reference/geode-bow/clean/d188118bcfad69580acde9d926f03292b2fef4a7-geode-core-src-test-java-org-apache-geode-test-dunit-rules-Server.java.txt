Refactor test rules

* Refactor GfshShellConnectorRule so that it's easier to use it either as a rule or classRule
* Refactor LocatorServerStartupRule so that tests using it do not need to extend from Junit4DUnitTest and can be used as a class rule.
* properly close all the vms using the ServerStartupRule
* add NetstatDUnitTest
