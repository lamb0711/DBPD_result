GEODE-2267: Enhance server/locator startup rules

* be able to return the rule itself so that we can start the server/locator at rule declaration time.
* rearrange the class structure
* do not delete the workingDir if the rule is created with a workingDir (then it's up for the caller to delete it)

+import org.apache.geode.test.dunit.rules.MemberVM;
-    Server server0 = lsRule.startServerAsJmxManager(0, jmxPort);
+    MemberVM server0 = lsRule.startServerAsJmxManager(0, jmxPort);
-    Server server0 = lsRule.startServerAsEmbededLocator(0, locatorPort, jmxPort);
-    Server server1 = lsRule.startServerVM(1, locatorPort);
+    MemberVM server0 = lsRule.startServerAsEmbededLocator(0, locatorPort, jmxPort);
+    MemberVM server1 = lsRule.startServerVM(1, locatorPort);
