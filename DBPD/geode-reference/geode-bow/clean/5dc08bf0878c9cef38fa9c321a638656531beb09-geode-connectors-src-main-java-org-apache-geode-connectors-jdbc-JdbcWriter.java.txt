GEODE-4844: JdbcWriter and JdbcAsyncWriter will write rows loaded by the JdbcLoader (#1618)

* JdbcWriter and JdbcAsyncWriter will no longer write to sql 
  if the event was from a load. This will cause them to never write
  back out events from the JdbcLoader. It also means that if someone
  is using one of the jdbc writers on a region that uses some other loader
  that the jdbc writer will ignore data loaded by it. We think the common
  use case will be if you have a jdbc writer you will either also have the
  JdbcLoader or no loader. In the future we may need to add a feature so
  that a user can tell the jdbc writer to not ignore load events.


+import java.util.concurrent.atomic.LongAdder;

+    if (eventCanBeIgnored(event.getOperation())) {
+      return;
+    }
+    totalEvents.add(1);
+
+  long getTotalEvents() {
+    return totalEvents.longValue();
+  }
