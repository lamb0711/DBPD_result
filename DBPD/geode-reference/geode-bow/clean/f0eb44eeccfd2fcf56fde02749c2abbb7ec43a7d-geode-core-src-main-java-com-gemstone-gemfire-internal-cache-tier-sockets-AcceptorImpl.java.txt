-      // TODO: if we know *where* in the list this connection was, we
-      // could use ArrayUtils here.
-        if (this.crHelper.emulateSlowServer() > 0) {

-          catch (InterruptedException ugh) {
-            // This had better be due to shutdown; don't reenable the bit,
-            // it would just cause a hot-loop.
