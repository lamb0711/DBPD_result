GEODE-2804 Caching the InetAddress for configured ip string

1. We keep configure host string in HostAddress class
2. We reuse InetsocketAddress if it is ipString.
3. Client has logic to retry thus we keep InetsocketAddress even if
   it is not ip string.

GEODE-3017 IPv6 issue on windows. Above changes fixed this issue.

GEODE-2940 Now we don't validate configure host string on start. As
there is possibility that host may not available.

1. Earlier wan config were failing because of that. Now we just keep
   those configure host string. And try this later.

Added unit tests for it.

-            (RemoteLocatorJoinResponse) locatorClient.requestToServer(locatorId.getHost(),
-                locatorId.getPort(), request, WanLocatorDiscoverer.WAN_LOCATOR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT);
+            (RemoteLocatorJoinResponse) locatorClient.requestToServer(locatorId.getHost(), request,
+                WanLocatorDiscoverer.WAN_LOCATOR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT, true);
-                remoteLocator.getPort(), request,
-                WanLocatorDiscoverer.WAN_LOCATOR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT);
+                request, WanLocatorDiscoverer.WAN_LOCATOR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT, true);
-                    remoteLocator.getPort(), pingRequest,
-                    WanLocatorDiscoverer.WAN_LOCATOR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT);
+                    pingRequest, WanLocatorDiscoverer.WAN_LOCATOR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT, true);
