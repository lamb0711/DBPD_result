GEODE-2403: Increment query executed stats before lastResult

	* The stat for number of queries executed is now incremented before the lastResult call.
	* Before, this was called in the finally block. This resulted in the increment even if there was a exception.

-    stats.incInt(queryExecutionsId, 1);
+
+  public void incNumberOfQueryExecuted() {
+    stats.incInt(queryExecutionsId, 1);
+  }
