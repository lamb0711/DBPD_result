GEODE-3529 move new client/server security classes to a different package

The new classes/interfaces have been moved to org.apache.geode.security.server.

A package.html is now provided that describes the purpose of the package.

The word "Stream" has been removed from the names of these classes.  Those
names make sense in the context of the Protobuf support classes in
org.apache.geode.internal.cache.tier.sockets classes but not when taken
as a separate group of classes.

The method Authenticator.receiveMessage() has been renamed to
Authenticator.authenticate().

This closes #746

-package org.apache.geode.security;
+package org.apache.geode.security.server;
+import org.apache.geode.security.AuthenticationRequiredException;
+import org.apache.geode.security.SecurityManager;

-public interface StreamAuthenticator {
+public interface Authenticator {
-  void receiveMessage(InputStream inputStream, OutputStream outputStream,
+  void authenticate(InputStream inputStream, OutputStream outputStream,
-   * always be passed to the StreamAuthenticator. Once authentication succeeds, calls to this
-   * function must always return true.
+   * always be passed to the Authenticator. Once authentication succeeds, calls to this function

-  StreamAuthorizer getAuthorizer() throws AuthenticationRequiredException;
