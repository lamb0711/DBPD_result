GEODE-5155 hang recovering transaction state for crashed server

The fix is to check to see if the message was removed due to a
memberDeparted event.

When that happens a departureNoticed flag was being set in TXCommitMessage
but the wait loop in the transaction tracker wasn't checking this flag.

+  /** return true if the member initiating this transaction has left the cluster */
+  public boolean isDepartureNoticed() {
+    return departureNoticed;
+  }
+
+
-    ThreadGroup group = LoggingThreadGroup.createThreadGroup("TXCommitMessage Threads", logger);
+    ThreadGroup group = LoggingThreadGroup.createThreadGroup("TXCommitMessage Threads", logger);
+
