GEODE-5783: have a single source for ThreadFactory

Use the keepalive parameter when initializing the thread factory.

I also made some logging changes while debugging the problems this
missing setting was causing.

-    return new ThreadPoolExecutor(corePoolSize, maximumPoolSize, 0, SECONDS, blockingQueue,
+    return new ThreadPoolExecutor(corePoolSize, maximumPoolSize, keepAliveSeconds, SECONDS,
+        blockingQueue,
