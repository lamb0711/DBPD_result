GEODE-8098: Refactor CommandFunction (#5082)

* CommandFunction code is now cleaner.
* Added SingleResultRedisFunction and a new ResultCollector class
to simplify and ensure that our function only has a single result.
* StripedExecutor has been simplified to only take a Callable

-import java.util.function.Consumer;
-  public <T> void execute(Object stripeId,
-      Callable<T> callable,
-      Consumer<T> resultConsumer) {
-    T resultOfCallable;
+  public <T> T execute(Object stripeId,
+      Callable<T> callable) {
-        resultOfCallable = callable.call();
+        return callable.call();
-    resultConsumer.accept(resultOfCallable);
