GEODE-917: rename gemfire subprojects to geode

Rename the gemfire-* subdirectories to geode-*.  This has the effect
of changing the maven published artifacts as well.  For example,

gemfire-core-1.0.0-incubating.M2-SNAPSHOT.jar

is now

geode-core-1.0.0-incubating.M2-SNAPSHOT.jar

Also took the opportunity to rename gemfire-core-dependencies.jar
to geode-dependencies.jar.

-   * @param warFilePrefix : the prefix of the war file, e.g. gemfire-web, gemfire-pulse, or gemfire-web-api
+   * @param warFilePrefix : the prefix of the war file, e.g. geode-web, geode-pulse, or geode-web-api
