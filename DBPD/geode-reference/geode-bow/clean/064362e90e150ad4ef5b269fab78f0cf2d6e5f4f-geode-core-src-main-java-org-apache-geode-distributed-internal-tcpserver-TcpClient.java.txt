GEODE-1793 LocatorDUnitTest.testStartTwoLocatorsOneWithSSLAndTheOtherNonSSL

This was a product issue.  When the locator using plain-text sockets is
contacted by a TcpClient using SSL the locator often just closes the socket.
On some platforms this causes a SSLHandshakeException but on others it
just causes a "SocketException: connection reset".  Writing some text to
the socket forces the TcpClient to get a SSLException (which is the superclass
of SSLHandshakeException).

The test class is still marked as Flaky due to GEODE-2542.

+import javax.net.ssl.SSLException;
-    } catch (SSLHandshakeException e) {
-      throw new LocatorCancelException("Unrecognisable response received", e);
+    } catch (SSLException e) {
+      throw new LocatorCancelException("Unable to form SSL connection", e);
