Merge branch 'feature/GEODE-8' into develop

+        // TODO: shouldn't we call continue here?
+        // It seems wrong to call writeMessage on a streamer we have just released.
+        // But why do we call release on a streamer when we had an exception on one
+        // of the previous streamer?
+        // release clears the direct bb and returns it to the pool but leaves
+        // it has the "buffer". THen we call writeMessage and it will use "buffer"
+        // that has also been returned to the pool.
+        // I think we only have a MsgStreamerList when a DS has a mix of versions
+        // which usually is just during a rolling upgrade so that might be why we
+        // haven't noticed this causing a bug.
