GEODE-77 adding additional test coverage

Test coverage is now > 71% for all membership services.
This also fixes a problem in GMSJoinLeave.join where a member that
was shut down & restarted with a start-locator setting formed a
split-brain.  Now we send a collection of previously attempted
coordinators with FindCoordinator requests, and a member receiving
a join request will check to see if the new member ought to assume
the role of coordinator.  See LocatorDUnitTest.testCollocatedLocatorWithSecurity.

+import com.gemstone.gemfire.distributed.internal.membership.gms.membership.GMSJoinLeave;
-        System.setProperty("gemfire.first-member", "true");
-        Locator.startLocatorAndDS(locatorPort, locatorLogFile, p);
+        System.setProperty(GMSJoinLeave.BYPASS_DISCOVERY, "true");
+        try {
+          Locator.startLocatorAndDS(locatorPort, locatorLogFile, p);
+        } finally {
+          System.getProperties().remove(GMSJoinLeave.BYPASS_DISCOVERY);
+        }
+
