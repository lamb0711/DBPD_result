GEODE-7852: Adding a SocketFactory configuration for client Pools (#4830)

Adding the ability to provide a SocketFactory to a client pool for use in
creating sockets. Adding an implementation of this SocketFactory that
configures the pool to use an SNI proxy.

Adding an automated test of the SniSocketFactory that uses docker compose
to use a real SNI proxy and geode servers that are not reachable without
going through the proxy.

+   * Sockets returned by this factory will have the rest of the configuration options

+   * sockets returned by this factory will be wrapped with SSLSockets if ssl is enabled
+   * for this client cache.
+   *
+   * This factory can be used for configuring a proxy, or overriding various socket settings.
