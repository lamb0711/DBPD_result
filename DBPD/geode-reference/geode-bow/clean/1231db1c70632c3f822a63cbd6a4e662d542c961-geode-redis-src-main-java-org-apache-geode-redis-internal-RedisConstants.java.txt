GEODE-8205: add gfsh redis command (#5226)

Unsupported commands can now be enabled dynamically on running servers using 'gfsh redis --enable-unsupported-commands'.

A warning is now logged if unsupported commands are enabled.
The error message has been improved.

-      "This command is unsupported. To enable it please start your system with the java system property '"
-          + GeodeRedisServer.ENABLE_REDIS_UNSUPPORTED_COMMANDS_PARAM + "=true'";
+      " is not supported. To enable all unsupported commands use GFSH to execute: 'redis --enable-unsupported-commands'. Unsupported commands have not been fully tested.";
