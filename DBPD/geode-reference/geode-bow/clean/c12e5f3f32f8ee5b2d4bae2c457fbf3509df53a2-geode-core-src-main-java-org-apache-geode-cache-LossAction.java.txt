GEODE-6380: Getting rid of nextOrindal pattern

We had some mutable statics that used a static nextOrdinal++ pattern.
This code worked, but it wasn't really necessary so removing the pattern
in favor of completely immutable static state.

-import org.apache.geode.annotations.internal.MakeImmutable;
-  public static final LossAction NO_ACCESS = new LossAction("NO_ACCESS");
+  public static final LossAction NO_ACCESS = new LossAction("NO_ACCESS", 0);
-  public static final LossAction LIMITED_ACCESS = new LossAction("LIMITED_ACCESS");
+  public static final LossAction LIMITED_ACCESS = new LossAction("LIMITED_ACCESS", 1);
-  public static final LossAction FULL_ACCESS = new LossAction("FULL_ACCESS");
+  public static final LossAction FULL_ACCESS = new LossAction("FULL_ACCESS", 2);
-  public static final LossAction RECONNECT = new LossAction("RECONNECT");
+  public static final LossAction RECONNECT = new LossAction("RECONNECT", 3);
-  public final byte ordinal = nextOrdinal++;
-
-  @MakeImmutable
-  private static byte nextOrdinal = 0;
+  public final byte ordinal;
-  private LossAction(String name) {
+  private LossAction(String name, int ordinal) {
+    this.ordinal = (byte) ordinal;
