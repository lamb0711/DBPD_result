GEODE-611: Change findbugs annotations to use ASL library

Swtich the findbugs annotation dependency to use an ASL version
from https://github.com/stephenc/findbugs-annotations.  This
library only supports the SuppressWarning annotation, not
SuppressFBWarning so some source files were updated.

-import edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressFBWarnings;
-
-  @SuppressFBWarnings(value="UL_UNRELEASED_LOCK", justification="This method unlocks and then conditionally undoes the unlock in the finally-block. Review again at later time.") 
+  @edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressWarnings(value="UL_UNRELEASED_LOCK", justification="This method unlocks and then conditionally undoes the unlock in the finally-block. Review again at later time.")
