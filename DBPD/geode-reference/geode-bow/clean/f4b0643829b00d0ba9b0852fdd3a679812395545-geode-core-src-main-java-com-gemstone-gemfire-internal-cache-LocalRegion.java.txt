GEODE-92: PR with entry eviction 1 leaves 3 entries in memory with async overflow

 Found that invoking lruUpdateCallback multiple times with in a single get
 could mess up entry eviction state. So disabled lru callback and invoked
 at the end of the operation.

+    boolean disabledLRUCallback = this.entries.disableLruUpdateCallback();
+    } finally {
+      if(disabledLRUCallback) {
+        this.entries.enableLruUpdateCallback();
+        this.entries.lruUpdateCallback();
+      }
