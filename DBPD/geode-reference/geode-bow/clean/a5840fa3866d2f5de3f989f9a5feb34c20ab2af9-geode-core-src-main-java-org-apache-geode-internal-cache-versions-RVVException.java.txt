GEODE-5559: Improve runtime of RegionVersionHolder.canonicalExceptions (#2298)

This modifies the RVVException to iterate over the received version newest to
oldest, which makes generating the canonical exceptions much more
straightforward.


-  public abstract ReceivedVersionsIterator receivedVersionsIterator();
+  public abstract ReceivedVersionsReverseIterator receivedVersionsReverseIterator();
-  /** it's a shame that BitSet has no iterator */
-  public abstract class ReceivedVersionsIterator {
+  public abstract class ReceivedVersionsReverseIterator {
