GEODE-8215: start server should fail if redis fails to start (#5202)

Added test to GeodeRedisServerStartupDUnitTest that showed
that the server did not fail to start even when the port was in use.
A ManagementException is now thrown instead of a RuntimeException.
Also found a place in the core that thought it was okay for redis-port to be -1.
GemFireCacheImpl intialize will now cleanup if an exception is thrown from handleResourceEvent.
-    system.handleResourceEvent(ResourceEvent.CLUSTER_CONFIGURATION_APPLIED, this);
+    boolean completedHandleResourceEvent = false;
+    try {
+      system.handleResourceEvent(ResourceEvent.CLUSTER_CONFIGURATION_APPLIED, this);
+      completedHandleResourceEvent = true;
+    } finally {
+      if (!completedHandleResourceEvent) {
+        try {
+          close();
+        } catch (Throwable ignore) {
+          // We don't want to throw an exception that came from the close
+          // so throw original exception from handleResourceEvent.
+        }
+      }
+    }
