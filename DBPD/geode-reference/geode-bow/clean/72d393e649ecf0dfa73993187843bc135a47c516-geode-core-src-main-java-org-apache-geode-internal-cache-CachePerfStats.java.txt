GEODE-5649 getAll() does not trigger client metadata refresh when primary bucket not known

If the primary for a bucket was not known when creating one-hop tasks we
were not scheduling a metadata refresh.

These changes initiate a refresh but allow the current operation to
continue as a non-single-hop operation.

This closes #2402

-    final String nonSingleHopsDesc =
-        "Total number of times client request observed more than one hop during operation.";
-            f.createLongCounter("nonSingleHopsCount", nonSingleHopsDesc,
-                "Total number of times client request observed more than one hop during operation.",
-                false),
-                "Total number of times the meta data is refreshed due to hopping.", false),
+                "refreshes", false),
