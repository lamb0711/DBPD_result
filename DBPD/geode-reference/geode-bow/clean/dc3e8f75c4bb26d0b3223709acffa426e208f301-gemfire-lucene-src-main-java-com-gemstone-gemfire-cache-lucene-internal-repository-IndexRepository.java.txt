Changing how PartitionRepositoryManager handles destroyed buckets

This class was using a weak hash map with BucketRegions as keys. Instead
of that, use the bucket id as the key. I added support to
IndexRepository for the repository to indicate if the underlying
BucketRegion has been destroyed. If the IndexRepository is destroyed, we
will create a new IndexRepository in PartitionRepositoryManager.

+  
+  /**
+   * Check to see if this repository is closed due to
+   * underlying resources being closed or destroyed
+   * @return true if this repository is closed.
+   */
+  public boolean isClosed();
