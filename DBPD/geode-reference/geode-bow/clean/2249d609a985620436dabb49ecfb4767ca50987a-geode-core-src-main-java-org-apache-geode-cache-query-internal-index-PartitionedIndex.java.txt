GEODE-4184: Handled concurrent access of HashSet

	* mapIndexKeys was a HashSet and concurrent access to it resulted in inconsistent data to be present.
	* Changed to a set with a concurrent hash map as a backing store.

+import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;
-  private HashSet mapIndexKeys = new HashSet();
+  protected Set mapIndexKeys = Collections.newSetFromMap(new ConcurrentHashMap());
