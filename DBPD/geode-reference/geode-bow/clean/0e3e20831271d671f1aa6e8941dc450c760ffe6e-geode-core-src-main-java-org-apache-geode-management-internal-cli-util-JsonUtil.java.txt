* GEODE-6808: Restore JSON backward compatibility

Reverted some of the changes made when deleting the in-house JSON

- Everything is serialized as JSON array with 2 elements: type & value.
- Internal class names are hidden in the JSON document, public
  interfaces are included instead.

  not being serialized as part of an array, in which case the type is
  ignored as it's already been serialized as ArrayElementType[].
