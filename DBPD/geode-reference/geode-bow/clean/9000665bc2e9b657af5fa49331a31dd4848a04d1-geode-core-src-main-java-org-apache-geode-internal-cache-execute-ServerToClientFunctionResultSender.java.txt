GEODE-5589: lastResultReceived set after msg sent (#2341)

        * To prevent situations where exceptions thrown in lastResult is not sent to the client.
	* This happens if we set the lastResultReceived and then an exception occurs.
	* exception is not sent back because the flag is set.
	* solution is now to set the flag only after the msg is sent from lastResult.
