GEODE-1463: Legacy OperationContexts do not set the appropriate Shiro
permission tuple

- Moved ResourceOperationContext into a 'public' package.
- Converted OperationContext into an interface.
- Cleaned up the hierarchy of everything that previously
  extended OperationContext.
- Marked GetOperationContext as abstract seeing that
  GetOperationContextImpl extends it and there are no uses of
  GetOperationContext anywhere. (So why does it still exist?).

-    super(postOperation);
-  }
-
-  /**
-   * Return the operation associated with the <code>OperationContext</code>
-   * object.
-   * 
-   * @return <code>OperationCode.REGION_DESTROY</code>.
-   */
-  @Override
-  public OperationCode getOperationCode() {
-    return OperationCode.REGION_DESTROY;
+    super(OperationCode.REGION_DESTROY, postOperation);
