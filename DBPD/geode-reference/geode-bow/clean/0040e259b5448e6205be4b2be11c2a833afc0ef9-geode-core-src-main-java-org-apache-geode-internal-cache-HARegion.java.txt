GEODE-3583: Marking static variables final that are never modified

To help reduce the number of mutable statics to look through, adding
final to all of the statics that are not actually mutated outside of a
static initializer.

This change *only* consists of adding final to these variables.

-      private static int HAS_REGISTERED_INTEREST_BIT = 0x01;
-      private static int IS_PRIMARY_BIT = 0x02;
+      private static final int HAS_REGISTERED_INTEREST_BIT = 0x01;
+      private static final int IS_PRIMARY_BIT = 0x02;
