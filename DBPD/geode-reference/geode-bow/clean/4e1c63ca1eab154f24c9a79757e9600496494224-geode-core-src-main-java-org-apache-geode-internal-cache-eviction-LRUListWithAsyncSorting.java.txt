GEODE-3869: Fix early eviction. (#1152)

* GEODE-3869: Fix early eviction.

While code review found that the refactoring moved "evictionNode.unsetRecentlyUsed()" to
"appendEntry()" which gets call by other places (adding entry into the list); this causes
the recently used entry to be evicted early.

+        evictionNode.unsetRecentlyUsed();
