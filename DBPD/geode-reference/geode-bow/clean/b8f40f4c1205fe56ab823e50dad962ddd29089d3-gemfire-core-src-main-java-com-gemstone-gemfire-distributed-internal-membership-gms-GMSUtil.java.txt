GEODE-77 adding new unit tests for GMSJoinLeave

This adds a bunch of new unit tests to GMSJoinLeaveJUnitTest and
fixes a number of problems exposed by the new tests.

Members were in the view multiple times.
Members were in the shutdownMembers collection multiple times.
Members could be in the crashedMembers collection multiple times.
View preparation was actually installing the view in the coordinator.
A rogue process could request removal of a member.
