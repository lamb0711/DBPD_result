GEODE-5557: Fix for false read conflict exception (#3492)

* Use HashMap instead of HashSet in TXRegionLockRequestImpl so that read and write lock held can be distinguished.
* Use boolean value to indicate a key is read locked by a read operation when detectReadConflicts is enabled.

-        rlr.addEntryKeys(this.uaMods.keySet());
+        Iterator<Object> it = this.uaMods.keySet().iterator();
+        while (it.hasNext()) {
+          // add key with isEvent set to TRUE, for keep BC
+          rlr.addEntryKey(it.next(), Boolean.TRUE);
+        }
+
-   * Returns a set of entry keys that this tx needs to request a lock for at commit time.
+   * Returns a map of entry keys that this tx needs to request a lock for at commit time.
-  private Set getLockRequestEntryKeys() {
-    HashSet result = null;
+  private Map getLockRequestEntryKeys() {
+    HashMap<Object, Boolean> result = null;
-          result = new HashSet();
+          result = new HashMap();
-        result.add(me.getKey());
