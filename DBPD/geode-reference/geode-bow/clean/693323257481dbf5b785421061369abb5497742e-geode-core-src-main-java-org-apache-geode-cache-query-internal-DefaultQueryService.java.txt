GEODE-7487: Update Running CQ Context (#4369)

- Added unit and integration tests.
- Implemented method to invalidate the cache used by CQs.
- Updated the context implementation to change the internal
  MethodInvocationAuthorizer used whenever the CQ resets the
  ExecutionContext.
- Added a warning message whenever the MethodInvocationAuthorizer 
  returned by the QueryConfigurationService is null.
-
-      throw new IllegalArgumentException("cache must not be null");
-    this.cache = cache;
+      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Cache must not be null");
+
+    this.cache = cache;
+
+    // Should never happen, adding the check as a safeguard.
+    if (this.methodInvocationAuthorizer == null) {
+      logger.warn(
+          "MethodInvocationAuthorizer returned by the QueryConfigurationService is null, problems might arise if there are queries using method invocations.");
+    }
