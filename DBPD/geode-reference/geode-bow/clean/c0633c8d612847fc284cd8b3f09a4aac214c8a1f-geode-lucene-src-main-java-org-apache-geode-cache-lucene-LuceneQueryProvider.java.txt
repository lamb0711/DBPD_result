Overhauling the javadocs for the LuceneService

Enhancing the javadocs with more detailed descriptions of what the
classes do, adding links to lucene classes where appropriate, and
removing some cruft that didn't match the current implementation.

This closes #410

+import java.io.DataOutput;
+import org.apache.geode.DataSerializer;
- * The instances of this class will be used for distributing Lucene Query objects and
- * re-constructing the Query object. If necessary the implementation needs to take care of
- * serializing and de-serializing Lucene Query object. Geode respects the DataSerializable contract
- * to provide optimal object serialization. For instance, {@link LuceneQueryProvider}'s toData
- * method will be used to serialize it when it is sent to another member of the distributed system.
- * Implementation of DataSerializable can provide a zero-argument constructor that will be invoked
- * when they are read with DataSerializer.readObject.
+ * <p>
+ * A factory for {@link Query} objects. An implementation of this interface is required by
+ * {@link LuceneQueryFactory#create(String, String, LuceneQueryProvider)} so that a query can be
+ * serialized and distributed to multiple nodes.
+ * </p>
+ * Instances of this interface are serialized using the standard
+ * {@link DataSerializer#writeObject(Object, DataOutput)},
+@FunctionalInterface
-   * @return A Lucene Query object which could be used for executing Lucene Search on indexed data
-   * @param index local lucene index the query is being constructed against.
-   * @throws LuceneQueryException if the provider fails to construct the query object
+   * @return A {@link Query} which will be executed against a Lucene index.
+   * @param index The {@link LuceneIndex} the query is being executed against.
+   * @throws LuceneQueryException if the provider fails to construct the query object. This will be
+   *         propagated to callers of the {@link LuceneQuery} find methods.
