+ * included in the snapshot, one snapshot file (.gfd) for each region. Example usage:
+ * When the parallel snapshot option is used for export, a file for each region will be created on
+ * every member that contains data for that region and the file name will include a unique
+ * identifier for the member that created the file. When loading a snapshot created using parallel
+ * mode, either the files from all members can be combined into a directory to load from on a single
+ * member or files can be distributed across any number of members and imported using the parallel
+ * snapshot option, provided the files are in the same directory on each member.
+ *
-   * Imports all files in the specified directory into the cache. The cache entries in a given
-   * snapshot file are loaded into the same region they were originally exported from (based on a
-   * corresponding region name). Files that do not match the supplied snapshot format will cause an
-   * import error.
