GEODE-1304: remove TODO OFFHEAP comments

Tickets have been filed with the information from the removed comments.

This checkin does change LocalRegion validatedCreate/Put/Destroy
to no longer do an offheap release; instead the calling method does.

-          // TODO OFFHEAP MERGE: add a writeValue that will cache in the event like so:
-          //byte[] newValueBytes = BlobHelper.serializeToBlob(this.newValueObj);
-          //this.event.setCachedSerializedNewValue(newValueBytes);
