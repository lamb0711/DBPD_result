ByteArrayWrapper now implementes DataSerializableFixedID which should save us 40 bytes each time it is serialized. (#5180)

- It no longer caches its "hash" and "string" form which will cut down its memory overhead by over 70%.
- When we convert a sequence of bytes to a String, the Coder no longer calls intern which will also save some memory and time.
-    String commandName = null;
-      commandName = Coder.bytesToString(charCommand).toUpperCase();
+      String commandName = Coder.bytesToString(charCommand).toUpperCase();
