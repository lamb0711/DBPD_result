GEODE-6842: Making serialization of CqNameToOpHashMap thread safe (#3680)

By making the CqNameToOpHashMap derive from ConcurrentHashMap and
taking a snapshot prior to serialization, we avoid a race where
this map could be mutated by a client registration thread while a
queue GII which includes this map is occuring in another thread.
-   * Basically just a HashMap<String, Integer> but limits itself to the CqNameToOp interface.
