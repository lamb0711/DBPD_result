GEODE-3380: There're 2 problems here
1) when removeAll is retried, it will get EntryNotFound exception. It should still put the remove event
into the AEQ.
2) An old bug fix in 8.2 was not merged into develop: when removeAll encounter EntryNotFound exception, should
return version tag of the tombstone.

This closes #674

+                    op.addEntry(ev);
+                    if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
+                      logger.debug(
+                          "RemoveAllPRMessage.doLocalRemoveAll:notify client and gateway for not-found-entry:"
+                              + ev);

+                  }
