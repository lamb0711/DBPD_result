new unit tests and code clean-up

New unit tests to increase code coverage.  I also tinkered with
trying to get EclEmma output from DUnit ChildVMs but it seems to
be run in a shutdownHook in parallel with the DUnitLauncher
shutdownHook.

+  private static boolean stopMainLoop = false;
+  
+  /**
+   * tells the main() loop to exit
+   */
+  public static void stopVM() {
+    stopMainLoop = true;
+  }
+  
-      while(true) {
+      while (!stopMainLoop) {
