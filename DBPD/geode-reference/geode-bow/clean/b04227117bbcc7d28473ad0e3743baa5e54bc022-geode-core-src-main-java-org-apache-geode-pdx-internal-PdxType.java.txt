 GEODE-2129 Make pdxType id random.

Right now pdxtype id has 4 bytes. Out of those 4 bytes, one byte
reserved for distributed-system-id, this make sure type id generated
from different cluster has different id. For rest of the three bytes we
just increment counter to create new pdxtype id. In the field, we have
observed that sometimes this pdxType Id collides. One reason could be
they end up having same distributed-system-id for the different cluster.
Thus to avoid a collision, we will be using hashcode of pdxType for
three bytes of pdxType id. That will reduce the possibility of
collision.

Apart from that changed getOldValue call to region.get in
PeerTypeRegistration.
