GEODE-917: rename gemfire subprojects to geode

Rename the gemfire-* subdirectories to geode-*.  This has the effect
of changing the maven published artifacts as well.  For example,

gemfire-core-1.0.0-incubating.M2-SNAPSHOT.jar

is now

geode-core-1.0.0-incubating.M2-SNAPSHOT.jar

Also took the opportunity to rename gemfire-core-dependencies.jar
to geode-dependencies.jar.

-      System.out.println("Usage: java -cp gemfire-core-dependencies.jar:$JTESTS com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.cache.RunCacheInOldGemfire mcastPort diskdir isPR doOps(true or false) isShutDownAll");
+      System.out.println("Usage: java -cp geode-dependencies.jar:$JTESTS com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.cache.RunCacheInOldGemfire mcastPort diskdir isPR doOps(true or false) isShutDownAll");
