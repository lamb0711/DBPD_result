GEODE-1494: Changing stats list to be a CopyOnWriteArrayList

The statsList used to track Statistics in InternalDistributedSystem was
managed under a lock. That was problematic, because code that iterates
on the list needs to hold the lock. If the code invoking callbacks for
GEODE-1494 was slow, that means the lock would block other stats
operations.

Changing this list to a copy on write array list to holding a lock for a
long period of time.

-    synchronized (l) {
-      Iterator<Statistics> it = l.iterator();
-      while (it.hasNext()) {
-        if (stopRequested()) return;
-        StatisticsImpl s = (StatisticsImpl)it.next();
-        if (s.usesSystemCalls()) {
-          HostStatHelper.refresh((LocalStatisticsImpl)s);
-        }
+    Iterator<Statistics> it = l.iterator();
+    while (it.hasNext()) {
+      if (stopRequested()) return;
+      StatisticsImpl s = (StatisticsImpl)it.next();
+      if (s.usesSystemCalls()) {
+        HostStatHelper.refresh((LocalStatisticsImpl)s);
