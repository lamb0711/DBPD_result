GEODE-1072: Removing HDFS related code

Removing all HDFS and EvictionCriteria created code. This code will be
reinstated on a branch to be cleaned up and merged as a separate module.

-   * Set custom {@link EvictionCriteria} for the region with start time and
-   * interval of evictor task to be run in milliseconds, or evict incoming rows
-   * in case both start and frequency are specified as zero.
-   * 
-   * @param criteria
-   *          an {@link EvictionCriteria} to be used for eviction for HDFS
-   *          persistent regions
-   * @param start
-   *          the start time at which periodic evictor task should be first
-   *          fired to apply the provided {@link EvictionCriteria}; if this is
-   *          zero then current time is used for the first invocation of evictor
-   * @param interval
-   *          the periodic frequency at which to run the evictor task after the
-   *          initial start; if this is if both start and frequency are zero
-   *          then {@link EvictionCriteria} is applied on incoming insert/update
-   *          to determine whether it is to be retained
