Lowering the log level for errors when cleaning up the index repository

Because we pull the rug out from under the IndexWriter when a member is
no longer primary, we may get exceptions back while trying to close the
writer.

-      } catch (IOException e) {
-        logger.warn("Unable to clean up index repository", e);
+      } catch (Exception e) {
+        logger.debug("Unable to clean up index repository", e);
