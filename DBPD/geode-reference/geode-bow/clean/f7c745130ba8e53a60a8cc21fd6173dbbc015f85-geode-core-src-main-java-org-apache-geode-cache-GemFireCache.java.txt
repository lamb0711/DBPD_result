GEODE-4693: fix JDBCLoader on non-object pdx fields (#1517)

If the region mapping has a pdxClassName then the JdbcLoader will look for a pdx type that is already defined and use its field types when creating the PdxInstance. If the pdx type does not have a field that corresponds to an existing column then an exception is thrown.

A pdx field of type "char" or an instance of "java.lang.Character" will be sent to SQL as a String of size 1.
A pdx field of type "Date" will be sent to SQL as a java.sql.Timestamp.

A new external API was added to GemFireCache. It is the method "registerPdxMetaData".
It only needs to be called on clients if they are going to do reads using a JdbcLoader of data that wa s not written using the JdbcWriter or JdbcAsyncWriter.
+   * Registers PDX meta-data given an instance of a domain class that will be serialized
+   * with PDX.
+   * <p>
+   * Note that if the instance is not of a class that will be serialized with PDX
+   * then no meta-data is registered.
+   * <p>
+   * Note that in most cases this method never needs to be called. Currently it is only
+   * needed by the JdbcLoader when gets are done for JDBC data that was not written to the
+   * table using geode.
+   *
+   * @param instance the instance of the domain class for which meta-data is to be registered
+   * @throws SerializationException if the instance can not be serialized
+   * @since Geode 1.6
