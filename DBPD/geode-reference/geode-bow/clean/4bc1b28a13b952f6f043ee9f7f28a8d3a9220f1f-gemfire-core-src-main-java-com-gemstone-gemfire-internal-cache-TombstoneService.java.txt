merge of hot-fix from closed-source 8.2x maintenance branch

The tombstone GC service ran into an NPE removing a tombstone and then
the thread went hot because exception-handling was not advancing to the
next GC candidate.  This revision attempts to avoid the NPE (which was
not reported with line numbers) and alters the exception-handling to
advance to the next tombstone if there is an unexpected problem removing
the current tombstone.

+    if (entry.getVersionStamp() == null) {
+      logger.warn("Detected an attempt to schedule a tombstone for an entry that is not versioned in region " + r.getFullPath(), new Exception("stack trace"));
+      return;
+    }
+              currentTombstoneLock.lock();
+              try {
+                currentTombstone = null;
+              } finally {
+                currentTombstoneLock.unlock();
+              }
