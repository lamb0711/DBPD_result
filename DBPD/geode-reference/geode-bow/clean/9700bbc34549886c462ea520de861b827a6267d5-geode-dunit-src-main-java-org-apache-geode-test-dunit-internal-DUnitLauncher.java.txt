GEODE-7826: start jmx-manager when the Management Rest Service is (#4820)

* Before the geode management rest service web app is added,
the code now starts the jmx-manager.

* Since the locator currently just logs a message if the management rest
service can not be started, this is now also the behavior if the
jmx-manager can not be started on behalf of the management rest service.
If that happens the management rest service will not be available and
you will get a warning logged describing why the jmx-manager could not
be started.
+import static org.apache.geode.distributed.ConfigurationProperties.ENABLE_MANAGEMENT_REST_SERVICE;
+        p.setProperty(ENABLE_MANAGEMENT_REST_SERVICE, "false");
