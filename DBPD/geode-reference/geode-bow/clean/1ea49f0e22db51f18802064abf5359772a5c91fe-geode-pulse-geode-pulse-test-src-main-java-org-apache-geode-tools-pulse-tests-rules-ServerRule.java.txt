GEODE-7186: Move HttpService implementation into its own module (#4040)

- For maven/gradle consumption, this component becomes an optional
  dependency.
- The CacheService.init() method now returns a boolean indicating
  whether the given service was initialized or not.
- Services are now created before cache creation resourcce events are
  emitted.
-import org.apache.geode.cache.internal.HttpService;
-  private HttpService jetty;
+  private InternalHttpService jetty;
-
-    jetty = new InternalHttpService(LOCALHOST, httpPort, new SSLConfig());
+    jetty = new InternalHttpService();
+    jetty.createJettyServer(LOCALHOST, httpPort, new SSLConfig());
-    jetty.stop();
+    jetty.close();
