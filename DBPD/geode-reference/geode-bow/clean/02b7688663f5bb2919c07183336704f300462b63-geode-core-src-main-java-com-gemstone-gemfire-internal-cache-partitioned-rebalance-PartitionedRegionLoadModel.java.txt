GEODE-1153: BucketOperatorWrapper fails to invoke completion callback.

 * Fixed BucketOperatorWrapper to invoke onFailure if bucket creation fails
 * Promoted BucketOperatorWrapper & BucketOperatorImpl to be higher level classes
   to ease unit test callback invocation
 * Added JUnit tests to test these higher level classes
 * Added a DUnit to test redundancy is met if redundant bucket creation fails

+        //remove the bucket from lowRedundancyBuckets before mutating the state
+        lowRedundancyBuckets.remove(bucket);
