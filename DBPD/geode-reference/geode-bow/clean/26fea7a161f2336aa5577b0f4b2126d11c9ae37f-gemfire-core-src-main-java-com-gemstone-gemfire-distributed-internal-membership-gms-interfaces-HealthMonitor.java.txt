This also fixes a few bugs that I found during testing.  GMSMember wasn't
serializing correctly in some cases.
I also found that gfsh has a showDeadlock command and hooked in the new
findDeepestGraph DependencyGraph search.  If gfsh can't find a deadlock
it will now report on the deepest call chain it can find, which often
points to the source of a problem in the distributed system.
