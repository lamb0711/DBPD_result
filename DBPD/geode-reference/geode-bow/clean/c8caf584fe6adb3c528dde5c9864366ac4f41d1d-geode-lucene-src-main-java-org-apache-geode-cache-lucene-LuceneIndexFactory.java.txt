GEODE-3240: Refactor LuceneSerializer to have only a toDocuments method

Refactoring our internal LuceneSerializer API to have a method called
toDocuments, which matches the API we want to have when we make this
class public.

-
-  /**
-   * Configure the way objects are converted to lucene documents for this lucene index
-   * 
-   * @param luceneSerializer A callback which converts a region value to a lucene document or
-   *        documents to be stored in the index.
-   */
-  public LuceneIndexFactory setLuceneSerializer(LuceneSerializer luceneSerializer);
