GEODE-6573: move methods from ConnectionManager to Connection (#3375)

Connection now has default implementations of getWrappedConnection,
activate, and passivate. ConnectionManager no longer has these methods.

-
-  /**
-   * Used to active a thread local connection
-   *
-   * @return true if connection activated, false if could not be activated because it is destroyed
-   * @throws InternalGemFireException when the connection is already active
-   */
-  boolean activate(Connection conn);
-
-  /**
-   * Used to passivate a thread local connection
-   *
-   * @throws InternalGemFireException when the connection is already passive
-   */
-  void passivate(Connection conn, boolean accessed);
-
-  Connection getConnection(Connection conn);
