GEODE-599: fix clear with concurrent writes

Cache modification lock was being released before operation distribution to other members.
This provided a small window in which an operation from another thread could update the
region prior to the other members receiving notification (i.e. down leveled)

This closes #232

+import com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.cache.AbstractRegionMap.ARMLockTestHook;
+
+  @Override
+  public ARMLockTestHook getARMLockTestHook() {
+    return null;
+  }
