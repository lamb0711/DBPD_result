* moved state from SimpleMemoryAllocatorImpl to FreeListManager
* refactored and cleaned up release/free code
* Removed ChunkType and ChunkFactory. They were no longer used by GemFire and complicated the code
* removed BATCH_SIZE; it was an expirement that was not longer used
* combined Chunk and GemFireChunk to the new ObjectChunk class
