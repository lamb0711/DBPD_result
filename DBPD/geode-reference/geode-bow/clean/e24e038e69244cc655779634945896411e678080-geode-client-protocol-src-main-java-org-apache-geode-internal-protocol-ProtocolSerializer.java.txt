GEODE-4080: Protobuf JSON objects are in a proto string (#1171)

* GEODE-4080: Protobuf JSON objects are in a proto string

In the process, remove a couple of serialization-related classes that
are no longer really applicable.

* Catch `JSONFormatterException` and return it as a `EncodingException`.
* Change some names and add ProtobufSerializationService, which is the big
reason for all this churn.
* Get rid of the codec package
* Inline the serialization type enum
* Make encoding methods throw EncodingException.
* Don't use exceptions for control flow.

This meant renaming ProtobufPrimitiveTypes to ProtobufEncodingTypes.
