GEODE-3540: unable to gfsh destroy gateway-sender (#1414)

   GW sender bean is not unregistered during destroy command which
   is why it appears when you list gateways after destroy. This fix is to 
   unregistered the MX bean from SystemManagementService
+      case GATEWAYSENDER_REMOVE:
+        GatewaySender removedSender = (GatewaySender) resource;
+        adapter.handleGatewaySenderRemoved(removedSender);
+        break;
