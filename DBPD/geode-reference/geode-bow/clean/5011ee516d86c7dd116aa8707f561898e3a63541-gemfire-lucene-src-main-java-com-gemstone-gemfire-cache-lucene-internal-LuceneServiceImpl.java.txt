Adding xml parsing and generation logic

We now have an xsd for the lucene elements, and a LuceneXmlParser
service. Geode already has a mechanism to plug in additional xml parsers
like LuceneXmlParsers by using the java service loader, which I have
done.

I've written a LuceneIndexCreation object to match other configuration
objects that get generated when a cache is parsed. This creation is
attached to regions on index creation time so that when xml is
generated, the creation object and generate the appropriate xml snippet.

+import com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.lucene.internal.xml.LuceneServiceXmlGenerator;
-    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
-    return null;
+    return new LuceneServiceXmlGenerator();
-    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
-
+    //This is called when CacheCreation (source) is turned into a GemfireCacheImpl (target)
+    //nothing to do there.
