GEODE-8215: start server should fail if redis fails to start (#5202)

Added test to GeodeRedisServerStartupDUnitTest that showed
that the server did not fail to start even when the port was in use.
A ManagementException is now thrown instead of a RuntimeException.
Also found a place in the core that thought it was okay for redis-port to be -1.
GemFireCacheImpl intialize will now cleanup if an exception is thrown from handleResourceEvent.
-        if (event == ResourceEvent.CACHE_CREATE) {
+        if (event == ResourceEvent.CACHE_CREATE
+            || event == ResourceEvent.CLUSTER_CONFIGURATION_APPLIED) {
