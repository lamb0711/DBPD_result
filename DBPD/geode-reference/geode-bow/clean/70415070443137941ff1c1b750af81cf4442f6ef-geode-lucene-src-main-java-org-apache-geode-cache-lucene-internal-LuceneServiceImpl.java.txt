GEODE-4764: Address NPEs during Lucene index creation on existing region

* Don't add the aeq to the region until the data region has been created
* When iterating over list of local primary bucketIds (during reindexing), check for null return value when retrieving a specific bucket
* Added tests for same.

-    region.addAsyncEventQueueId(aeqId, true);
+    region.addAsyncEventQueueId(aeqId, true);
+
+          if (userBucket == null) {
+            throw new BucketNotFoundException(
+                "Bucket ID : " + primaryBucketId + " not found during lucene indexing");
+          }
