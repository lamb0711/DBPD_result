GEODE-7926: GMSMemberData is doing unnecessary reverse-DNS lookups

Removed hostname lookup from GMSMemberData a serialization method.
InternalDistributedMember does its own hostname lookup & there's no
reason for the lookup in GMSMemberData.  I found it was slowing down UDP
communications.

-      this.hostName = inetAddr.getHostName();
+      // use address as hostname at this level. getHostName() will do a reverse-dns lookup,
+      // which is very expensive
+      this.hostName = inetAddr.getHostAddress();
