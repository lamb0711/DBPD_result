GEODE-1810: WAN locator exchange doesn't include hostname-for-clients if it is set

While exchanging locators, DistributionLocatorID will be constructed
using hostNameforClients. It looks like this was happening if an
embedded locator was started using the start-locator distributed system
property, but not for any other case.

Adding a test that we actually send the hostname for clients to remote
locators.

-  public static final StringId LOCATOR_DISCOVERY_TASK_EXCHANGED_LOCATOR_INFORMATION_0_WITH_1 = new StringId(5203, "Locator discovery task exchanged locator information {0} with {1}.");
+  public static final StringId LOCATOR_DISCOVERY_TASK_EXCHANGED_LOCATOR_INFORMATION_0_WITH_1 = new StringId(5203, "Locator discovery task exchanged locator information {0} with {1}: {2}.");
