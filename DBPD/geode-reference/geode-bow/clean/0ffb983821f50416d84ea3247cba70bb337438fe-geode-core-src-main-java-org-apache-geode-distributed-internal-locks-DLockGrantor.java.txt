Revert "GEODE-4928 DistributedLockService doesn't work as expected while the dlock grantor is initialized"

Reverting - this caused CI to hang.

This reverts commit f3b47a5a8ba65fbcf0915e94da3ef3683962c43a.

-        DLockLessorDepartureHandler handler = this.dlock.getDLockLessorDepartureHandler();
-        // make sure the tx locks of departed members have been cleared so we don't have
-        // conflicts with non-existent members. This is done in a waiting-pool thread launched
-        // when the member-departure is announced.
-        handler.waitForInProcessDepartures();
