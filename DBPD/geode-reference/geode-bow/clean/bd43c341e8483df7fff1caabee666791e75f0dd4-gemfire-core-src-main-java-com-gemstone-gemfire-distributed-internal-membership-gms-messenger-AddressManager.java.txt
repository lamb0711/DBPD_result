new unit tests and code clean-up

New unit tests to increase code coverage.  I also tinkered with
trying to get EclEmma output from DUnit ChildVMs but it seems to
be run in a shutdownHook in parallel with the DUnitLauncher
shutdownHook.

-import org.jgroups.Message;
-import org.jgroups.protocols.UDP;
-//    logger.info("AddressManager.up: " + evt);
-    
-//      logger.debug("AddressManager.FIND_MBRS processing {}", missing);
+
-//            logger.debug("AddressManager.FIND_MBRS adding response {}", pd);
-      Exception problem = null;
-      } catch (InvocationTargetException e) {
-        problem = e;
-      } catch (IllegalAccessException e) {
-        problem = e;
-      }
-      if (problem != null && !warningLogged) {
-        log.warn("Unable to update JGroups address cache - this may affect performance", problem);
-        warningLogged = true;
+      } catch (InvocationTargetException | IllegalAccessException e) {
+        if (!warningLogged) {
+          log.warn("Unable to update JGroups address cache - this may affect performance", e);
+          warningLogged = true;
+        }
