GEODE-1387 CI Failure: LocatorLauncherRemoteFileIntegrationTest.testStatusUsingWorkingDirectory

The locator status file writer and reader are out of sync. The reader
may read the empty file before writer writes to it. So write the status
to a temp file, then rename it. So that the reader reads the status file
that has content in it.

-        boolean created = statusFile.createNewFile();
+        final File statusFileTmp = new File(workingDir, processType.getStatusFileName() + ".tmp");
+        if (statusFileTmp.exists()) {
+          statusFileTmp.delete();
+        }
+        boolean created = statusFileTmp.createNewFile();
-        final FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(statusFile);
+        final FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(statusFileTmp);
+        boolean renamed = statusFileTmp.renameTo(statusFile);
+        assert renamed;
