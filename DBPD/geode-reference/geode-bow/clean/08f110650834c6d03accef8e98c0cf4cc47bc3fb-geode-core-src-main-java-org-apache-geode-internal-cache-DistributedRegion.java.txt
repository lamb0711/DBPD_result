GEODE-5505 Cache listener not invoked on a retried destroy() operation

This started happening when we moved listener/client notification to
LocalRegion.basicDestroyPart2.  The code to handle duplicate destroys
from a client was only invoking basicDestroyPart3.

This closes #2233

-        if (isTraceEnabled) {
-          logger.trace("DR.virtualPut: this cache has already seen this event {}", event);
+        if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
+          logger.debug("DR.virtualPut: this cache has already seen this event {}", event);
