GEODE-5649 getAll() does not trigger client metadata refresh when primary bucket not known

If the primary for a bucket was not known when creating one-hop tasks we
were not scheduling a metadata refresh.

These changes initiate a refresh but allow the current operation to
continue as a non-single-hop operation.

This closes #2402

-        final boolean isDebugEnabled = logger.isDebugEnabled();
