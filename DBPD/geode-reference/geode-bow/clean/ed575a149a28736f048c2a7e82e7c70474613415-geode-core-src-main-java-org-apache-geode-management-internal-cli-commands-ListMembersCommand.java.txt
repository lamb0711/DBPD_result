GEODE-5011: Require all ResultModel sections to be explicitly named (#1944)


- Remove the auto-indexed naming inherited from the previous implementation.
- Remove section named "error"
- When using createError, the section will just be named "info", however the
  state will be set to ERROR.
+
+  public static final String MEMBERS_SECTION = "members";
+
-    TabularResultModel resultData = crm.addTable();
+    TabularResultModel resultData = crm.addTable(MEMBERS_SECTION);
