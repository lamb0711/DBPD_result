GEODE-7556e - catch and translate exceptions into geode-core exceptions (#4519)

added a few more translation points.  These changes are for
non-opensource legacy tests that are looking for
ForcedDisconnectException as a cause for a cache disconnecting.  There
is nothing in Geode that expects this so I have not added tests that
require it.
+import org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.membership.gms.api.MemberDisconnectedException;
+        if (rc instanceof MemberDisconnectedException) {
+          rc = new ForcedDisconnectException(rc.getMessage());
+        }
