GEODE-1714: fix disk stats

A number of places were found that did not correctly
change the DiskRegionStats: entriesInVM and entriesOnlyOnDisk.
Also found places that did not correctly change
the entry count and size of a PR bucket region.
EntriesInVM is supposed to only count entries that have a value
stored in the JVM. But it was also counting invalid entries.
Since invalid entries do not have a value this stat no longer counts them.

-        if (entry.isInvalidOrRemoved()) {
+        Token entryVal = entry.getValueAsToken();
+        if (entryVal == null) {
+          if (logger.isTraceEnabled(LogMarker.LRU)) {
+            logger.trace(LogMarker.LRU, "no need to evict already evicted key={}", entry.getKey());
+          }
+          return 0;
+        }
+        if (Token.isInvalidOrRemoved(entryVal)) {
-            logger.trace(LogMarker.LRU, "no need to evict invalid/localInvalid/destroyed token for key={}", entry.getKey());
+            logger.trace(LogMarker.LRU, "no need to evict {} token for key={}", entryVal, entry.getKey());
