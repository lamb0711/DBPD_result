GEODE-1810: WAN locator exchange doesn't include hostname-for-clients if it is set

While exchanging locators, DistributionLocatorID will be constructed
using hostNameforClients. It looks like this was happening if an
embedded locator was started using the start-locator distributed system
property, but not for any other case.

Adding a test that we actually send the hostname for clients to remote
locators.

-      this.locatorDiscoverer.discover(getPort(), config, locatorListener);
+      this.locatorDiscoverer.discover(getPort(), config, locatorListener, hostnameForClients);
