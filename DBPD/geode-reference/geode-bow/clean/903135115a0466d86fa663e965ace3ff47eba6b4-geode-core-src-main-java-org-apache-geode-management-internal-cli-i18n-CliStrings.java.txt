GEODE-734: Remove txt file restriction when exporting stack traces

Adding throws clause to signature instead of catching it in Test.

Separating test scenarios into multiple test cases. Creating files in
TemporaryFolder.

Applying spotless checks

Updated export stack-traces in controller. Removed compulsory file
option. If file is not provided then name is generated. Added one
boolean option fail-if-file-present, if true and file already exists
then command will fail.

Updated Offline help file.

Added test cases to verify new added options

Removed compulsory file option. If file is not provided then name is
generated. Added one boolean option fail-if-file-present, if true and
file already exists then command will fail.

Added message warning user about possible overwrite of file if already
present.

Added test to check if non txt extension file is allowed.

This closes #297
