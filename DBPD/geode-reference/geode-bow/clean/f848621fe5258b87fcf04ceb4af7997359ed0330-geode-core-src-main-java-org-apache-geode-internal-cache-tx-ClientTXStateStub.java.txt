GEODE-4588: remove call of getAnyInstance (#1394)

Now an InternalDistributedSystem is passed in to the TXLockServiceImpl
constructor. Note that this service depends on the distributed system
instead of the cache.
-      lockReq.obtain();
+      lockReq.obtain(cache.getInternalDistributedSystem());
