GEODE-4685: Moving of static DefaultQuery.setPdxReadSerialized to the TypeRegistry.
Cleaned up the overriding of readSerialized to reset to previous value.
Added cache to AbstractJdbcCallback.java so that children classes can access it.
Replaced AtomicLong with LongAdder.

+  private final ThreadLocal<Boolean> pdxReadSerializedOverride =
+      ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> Boolean.FALSE);

+  public void setPdxReadSerializedOverride(boolean overridePdxReadSerialized) {
