GEODE-1304: remove TODO OFFHEAP comments

Tickets have been filed with the information from the removed comments.

-      // TODO OFFHEAP: This estimate will not take into account the memory saved by inlining the keys.
+      // This estimate will not take into account the memory saved by inlining the keys.
