GEODE-77 bugfixes from code review

ClientProxyMembershipID's clientVersion may be null.  toData was
assuming that it was never null and caused NPEs.

InternalDistributedSystem needs to tell the locator whether there was
a forced-disconnect but was using the wrong value.  It needs to use
its forcedDisconnect boolean instead of the preparingForReconnect
parameter.

-            this.startedLocator.stop(preparingForReconnect, preparingForReconnect, false);
+            this.startedLocator.stop(forcedDisconnect, preparingForReconnect, false);
