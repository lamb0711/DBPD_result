GEODE-1546: fix issue when a proxy server was shut down before its scheduled task of removing departed client is invoked.

Move transactionTimeToLive setting into TXManagerImpl.
Update proxy server to track the latest proxy after failover.
Expire client transactions if they do not fail over to new proxy servers and after transaction timeout period.
Add test cases for the above scenario.
Refactored the test code and made transactionTimeToLive setting adjustable to reduce test running time.

-   * The number of seconds to keep transaction states for disconnected clients.
-   * This allows the client to fail over to another server and still find
-   * the transaction state to complete the transaction.

-    this.messageTimeToLive = CacheServer.DEFAULT_MESSAGE_TIME_TO_LIVE;
