Changing IndexManager to take a RegionFunctionContext

The LuceneSearchFunctionArgs class had a getBuckets method, but it
didn't make sense because we want to search only the local data set.
Change the API to pass the function context to the RepositoryManager.

-import java.util.Set;
+import com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.execute.RegionFunctionContext;
-   * @param buckets buckets of a Partitioned region for which {@link IndexRepository}s needs to be discovered. null
-   *          for all primary buckets on this member or if the region is Replicated.
+   * @param ctx function context for which {@link IndexRepository}s needs to be discovered. 
-  Collection<IndexRepository> getRepositories(Region region, Set<Integer> buckets) throws BucketNotFoundException;
+  Collection<IndexRepository> getRepositories(Region region, RegionFunctionContext ctx) throws BucketNotFoundException;
