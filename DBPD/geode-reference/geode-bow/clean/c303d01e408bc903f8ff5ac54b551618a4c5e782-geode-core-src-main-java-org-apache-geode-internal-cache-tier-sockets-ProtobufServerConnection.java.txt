GEODE-5043: Buffering protobuf output to avoid multiple packet sends (#1768)

GEODE-5043: Buffering protobuf output to avoid multiple packet sends

Based on the stats all protobuf requests and responses were being sent
as two packets. Using a BufferedOutputStream to make sure we only send 1
packet

+import java.io.BufferedOutputStream;
-import java.io.OutputStream;
+  private final BufferedOutputStream output;
-      SecurityService securityService) {
+      SecurityService securityService) throws IOException {
+    this.output = new BufferedOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream(), socketBufferSize);
-      OutputStream outputStream = socket.getOutputStream();
-        protocolProcessor.processMessage(inputStream, outputStream);
+        try {
+          protocolProcessor.processMessage(inputStream, output);
+        } finally {
+          output.flush();
+        }
