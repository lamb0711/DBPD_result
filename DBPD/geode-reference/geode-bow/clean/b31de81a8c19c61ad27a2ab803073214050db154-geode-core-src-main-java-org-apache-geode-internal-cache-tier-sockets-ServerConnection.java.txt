GEODE-3082 Integrate GenericProtocolServerConnection with ClientHealthMonitor.

1. Now GenericProtocolServerConnection creates ClientProxyMembershipId.
2. ClientHealthMonitor gets notified about pings
3. added test where CHM closes the connection.
4. added test where CHM doesn't close the connection

This currently results in every connetion being tracked as a separate
client.

+  protected int getClientReadTimeout() {
