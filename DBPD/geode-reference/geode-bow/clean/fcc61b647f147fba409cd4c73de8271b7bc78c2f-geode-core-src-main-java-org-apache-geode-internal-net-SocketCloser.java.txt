GEODE-6011: Prevent synchronization using strings and boolean (#2807)

* Locking is now achieved using reentrant locks as they are more fair than synchronization.

+import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;
+  /**
+   * Protect access to closed synchronizing with closedLock
+   */
+  private final ReentrantLock closedLock = new ReentrantLock();
+  /**
+   * Protect access to closed using synchronizing with closedLock
+   */
-    synchronized (this) {
+    closedLock.lock();
+    try {
+    } finally {
+      closedLock.unlock();
-      synchronized (this) {
+      closedLock.lock();
+      try {
+      } finally {
+        closedLock.unlock();
