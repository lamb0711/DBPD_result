GEODE-5686: Remove LocalizedStrings

This removes the LocalizedStrings class and most uses of LogWriterI18n.
The I18n interfaces are still in place and still work since they're only
deprecated but there are no longer any uses of the StringID logging methods.

Going forward everyone should use the Log4j logging facility.  If you
must use the deprecated LogWriter use that version and not
LogWriterI18n.

-import org.apache.geode.internal.i18n.LocalizedStrings;
-          LocalizedStrings.TXEntryUserAttrState_ENTRY_USER_ATTRIBUTE_FOR_KEY_0_ON_REGION_1_HAD_ALREADY_BEEN_CHANGED_TO_2
-              .toLocalizedString(new Object[] {key, r.getFullPath(), curCmtValue}));
+          String.format(
+              "Entry user attribute for key  %s  on region  %s  had already been changed to  %s",
+              new Object[] {key, r.getFullPath(), curCmtValue}));
