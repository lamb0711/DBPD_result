GEODE-5925 locks are not released in shutdown hook

If the cache is closed because the JVM is exiting we aren't releasing
locks until the DistributedSystem disconnects.  This alters the behavior
of shutdown and, in particular, causes long delays in designating new
primary bucket owners and reestablishing redundancy.

This commit enables unlocking during shutdown.

This closes #2725
