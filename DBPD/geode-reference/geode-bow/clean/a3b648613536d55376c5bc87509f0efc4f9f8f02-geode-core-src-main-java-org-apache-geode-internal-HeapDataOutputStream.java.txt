GEODE-5984 Address LGTM recommendations

Addressing minor issues in javadocs and code reported by LooksGoodToMe.

One change that I made wasn't reported by that tool: I removed
two static variables from AcceptorImpl that duplicated variables in
Handshake.

This closes #2780

-    buffer.put((byte) b);
+    buffer.put((byte) (b & 0xff));
-    buffer.putShort((short) v);
+    buffer.putShort((short) (v & 0xffff));
