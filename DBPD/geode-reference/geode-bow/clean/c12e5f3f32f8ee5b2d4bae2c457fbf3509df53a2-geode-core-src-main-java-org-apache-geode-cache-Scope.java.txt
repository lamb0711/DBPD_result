GEODE-6380: Getting rid of nextOrindal pattern

We had some mutable statics that used a static nextOrdinal++ pattern.
This code worked, but it wasn't really necessary so removing the pattern
in favor of completely immutable static state.

-import org.apache.geode.annotations.internal.MakeImmutable;
-  public static final Scope LOCAL = new Scope("LOCAL");
+  public static final Scope LOCAL = new Scope("LOCAL", 0);
-  public static final Scope DISTRIBUTED_NO_ACK = new Scope("DISTRIBUTED_NO_ACK");
+  public static final Scope DISTRIBUTED_NO_ACK = new Scope("DISTRIBUTED_NO_ACK", 1);
-  public static final Scope DISTRIBUTED_ACK = new Scope("DISTRIBUTED_ACK");
+  public static final Scope DISTRIBUTED_ACK = new Scope("DISTRIBUTED_ACK", 2);
-  public static final Scope GLOBAL = new Scope("GLOBAL");
+  public static final Scope GLOBAL = new Scope("GLOBAL", 3);
-  // The 4 declarations below are necessary for serialization
-  /** int used as ordinal to represent this Scope */
-  public final int ordinal = nextOrdinal++;
-
-  @MakeImmutable
-  private static int nextOrdinal = 0;
+  public final int ordinal;
-  private Scope(String name) {
+  private Scope(String name, int ordinal) {
+    this.ordinal = ordinal;
