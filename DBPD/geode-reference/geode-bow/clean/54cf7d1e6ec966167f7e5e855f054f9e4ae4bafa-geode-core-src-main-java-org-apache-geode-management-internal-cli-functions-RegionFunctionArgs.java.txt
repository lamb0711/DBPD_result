GEODE-5983: use equals() instead of == (#2777)

* For boxed primitive types equals() is used instead of ==
-      return time == that.time && action == that.action;
+      if (time == null && that.time == null && action == that.action) {
+        return true;
+      }
+      return time != null && time.equals(that.time) && action == that.action;
