GEODE-871: Frequient use of executeOnAllServers causes build-up of TIME_WAIT sockets

Modified the fix to not abort the connection if a response wasn't read.
I also propagated this pattern to GMSHealthMonitor so that the "final
check" sockets are quickly released.

-          socket.setSoLinger(true, (int)memberTimeout);
-          socket.setSoLinger(true, (int)memberTimeout);
+          clientSocket.setSoLinger(true, 0); // abort the connection
