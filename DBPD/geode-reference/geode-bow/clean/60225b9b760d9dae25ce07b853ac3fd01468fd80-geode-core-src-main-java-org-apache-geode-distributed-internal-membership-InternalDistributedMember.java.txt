GEODE-3153 Client receives duplicate events during rolling upgrade

The previous fix worked fine for 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 clients but there are
old GemFire 8.2 clients still in use that the fix did not work for.
This patch changes the serialization to always send UUID bytes to pre
Version.GFE_90 (1.0.0-incubating) clients.

Added unit for it

-    if (InternalDataSerializer.getVersionForDataStream(out).compareTo(Version.GFE_90) == 0) {
+    Version outputVersion = InternalDataSerializer.getVersionForDataStream(out);
+    if (0 <= outputVersion.compareTo(Version.GFE_90)
+        && outputVersion.compareTo(Version.GEODE_110) < 0) {
