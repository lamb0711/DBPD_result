GEODE-5220: Validate Region Attributes Earlier

- Added unit and distribution tests.
- Removed references to old bug tracking system.
- Removed unused `throws Exception` clause from
  `MemberVM.waitTilGatewaySendersAreReady()`.
- `DistributedRegion` creation fails ealier whenever the associated
  `async-event-queue` / `gateway-sender` is configured as `parallel`.
- Added `InternalRegion.preInitialize` method to execute validation
  before initializing the region, empty implementation by default.

+  /**
+   * Execute any validation required prior to initializing the region.
+   * This method should throw an exception whenever an invalid configuration is detected.
+   */
+  default void preInitialize() {
+    // Do nothing by default.
+  }
+
