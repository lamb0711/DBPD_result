GEODE-6380: Getting rid of nextOrindal pattern

We had some mutable statics that used a static nextOrdinal++ pattern.
This code worked, but it wasn't really necessary so removing the pattern
in favor of completely immutable static state.

-import org.apache.geode.annotations.internal.MakeImmutable;
-  public static final SystemMemberType MANAGER = new SystemMemberType("GemFireManager");
+  public static final SystemMemberType MANAGER = new SystemMemberType("GemFireManager", 0);
-  public static final SystemMemberType APPLICATION = new SystemMemberType("Application");
+  public static final SystemMemberType APPLICATION = new SystemMemberType("Application", 1);
-  public static final SystemMemberType CACHE_VM = new SystemMemberType("CacheVm");
+  public static final SystemMemberType CACHE_VM = new SystemMemberType("CacheVm", 2);
-  public final int ordinal = nextOrdinal++;
-
-  @MakeImmutable("nextOrdinal is not required, it could be passed into the constructors")
-  private static int nextOrdinal = 0;
+  public final int ordinal;
-  private SystemMemberType(String name) {
+  private SystemMemberType(String name, int ordinal) {
+    this.ordinal = ordinal;
