GEODE-6404: work around possible sync issue with computeIfAbsent (#3196)

* GEODE-6404: work around possible synchronization issue with computeIfAbsent

  *  Tries to do the get() outside of a lock before computing
  *  Added jmh test
  *  Local benchmarking showed that although jdk 11 fixes the contention issue that
       performing the get was faster than the retrieve mechanism of computeIfAbsent

-    Member m = _localCache.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> {
+    Member m = JavaWorkarounds.computeIfAbsent(_localCache, key, k -> {
