Removing TCPConduit's Stub ID class

This removes the Stub identifier class from TCPConduit.  This simplifies the
code since the DistributedMember IDs are propagated to all of the methods
that require identifiers and these IDs have all of the information Stubs
had.

The MembershipManager is also simplified since it doesn't have to keep
complicated mappings between Stubs and DistributedMembers.

-import com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.tcp.Stub;
-  public boolean memberExists(InternalDistributedMember m);
+  public boolean memberExists(DistributedMember m);
-   * Return a {@link Stub} referring to the given member.  A <em>null</em> may
-   * be returned if the system is not employing stubs for communication.
-   * 
-   * @param m the member
-   * @return the stub
-   */
-  public Stub getStubForMember(InternalDistributedMember m);
-  
-  /**
-   * Return a {@link InternalDistributedMember} associated with the given Stub.  This
-   * method may return a null if Stubs are not being used.
-   * @param s Stub to look up
-   * @param validated true if member must be in the current view
-   * @return the member associated with the given stub, if any
-   */
-  public InternalDistributedMember getMemberForStub(Stub s, boolean validated);

-  /**
-  public boolean addSurpriseMember(DistributedMember mbr, Stub stub);
+  public boolean addSurpriseMember(DistributedMember mbr);

+  /**
+   * Returns true if the member is being shunned
+   */
+  public boolean isShunned(DistributedMember m);
