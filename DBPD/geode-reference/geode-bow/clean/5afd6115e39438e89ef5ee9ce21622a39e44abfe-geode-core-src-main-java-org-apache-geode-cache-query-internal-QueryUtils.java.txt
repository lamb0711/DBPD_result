GEODE-6806: Ignore LIMIT in intermediate steps (#3629)

When joining multiple regions with indexes, only apply the LIMIT
clause in intermediate execution steps if the proper flag has been set
in the query context.

- Fixed minor warnings.
- Replaced `junit.Assert` by `assertj`.
- Added tests to validate query results of multiple joins.
-    int limit = getLimitValue(context);
-    // stops recursion if limit has already been met
+    // We do not know if the first X results might or might not fulfill all operands.
+    Boolean applyLimit = (Boolean) context.cacheGet(CompiledValue.CAN_APPLY_LIMIT_AT_INDEX);
+    int limit = (applyLimit != null && applyLimit) ? getLimitValue(context) : -1;
+
+    // Stops recursion if limit has already been met AND limit can be applied to index.
