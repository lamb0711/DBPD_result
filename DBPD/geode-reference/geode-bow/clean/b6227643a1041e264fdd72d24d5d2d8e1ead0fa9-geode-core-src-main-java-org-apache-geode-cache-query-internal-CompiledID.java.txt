GEODE-6053: Parameterized Queries fixed (#2859)

* Parameterized queries were throwing UnsupportedOperationExceptions.
	* This was because of trying to pre-compute values for join optimization.
	* When the query was parameterized it is not possible to compute these values and hence these exceptions are thrown
	* The fix was to prevent this computation when it is not needed or not possible.
