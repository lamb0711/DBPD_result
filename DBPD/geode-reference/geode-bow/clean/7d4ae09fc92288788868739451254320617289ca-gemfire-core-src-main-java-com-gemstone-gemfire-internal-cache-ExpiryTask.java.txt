GEODE-185: Fix races in testRegionIdleInvalidate

The test code is now careful to wait for the expiration clock to advance.
A different assertion will be triggered if the expiration clock goes back in time.
Fixed two places in the product expiration code that did not use the expiration clock.

-      ("[now:" + System.currentTimeMillis() + "]");
+      ("[now:" + calculateNow() + "]");
