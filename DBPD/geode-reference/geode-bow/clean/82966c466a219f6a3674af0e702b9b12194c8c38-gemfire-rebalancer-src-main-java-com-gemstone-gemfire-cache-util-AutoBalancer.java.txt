GEODE-464: Fix AutoBalancer test race condition

Instance of cache Initializer is not destroyed when the cache is destroyed. As a
result, a scheduled rebalance job can start after a different test starts. This
can cause failures. Add a destroy method to kill scheduler in test tearDown to
prevent orphaned tasks from failing other tests.

+    void destroy();
