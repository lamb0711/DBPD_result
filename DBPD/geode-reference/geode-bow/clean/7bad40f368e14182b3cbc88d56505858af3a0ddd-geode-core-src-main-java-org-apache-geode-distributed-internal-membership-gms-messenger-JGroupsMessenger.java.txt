GEODE-3034 exception on auto-reconnect attempt with multicast enabled

A bug in JGroups causes this exception.  A workaround is to add a
non-usable UUID-based address to the view that we use to reinialize
JGroups during an auto-reconnect attempt.  We've sent this issue to
the JGroups email list.

-        View jgv = new View(vid, new ArrayList<>());
+        List<Address> members = new ArrayList<>();
+        members.add(new UUID(0, 0));// TODO open a JGroups JIRA for GEODE-3034
+        View jgv = new View(vid, members);
