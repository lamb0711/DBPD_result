GEODE-3041 DistributedMemberDUnitTest.testGroupsInAllVMs fails intermittently

When shutting down the MembershipManager after it has joined we should not
use uncleanShutdown because the member will appear to have crashed.
Instead we should do a normal shutdown.

+    boolean beforeJoined = true;
+      beforeJoined = false; // we have now joined the system
+
-        distributionManager.uncleanShutdown(true);
+        distributionManager.uncleanShutdown(beforeJoined);
-  private void uncleanShutdown(boolean duringStartup) {
+  private void uncleanShutdown(boolean beforeJoined) {
-          this.channel.disconnect(duringStartup);
+          this.channel.disconnect(beforeJoined);
