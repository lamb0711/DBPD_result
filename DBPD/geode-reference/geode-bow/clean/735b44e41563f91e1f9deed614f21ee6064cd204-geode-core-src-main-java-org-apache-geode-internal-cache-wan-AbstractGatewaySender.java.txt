GEODE-4575: remove getAnyInstance call in CacheCreation (#1406)

Changed getInternalDistributedSystem to throw an exception if it is called.
It appears that this method is never used on a CacheCreation but because this
class implements the InternalCache interface it has to have an implementation.

* fixed a place the GatewaySender was asking for the
InternalDistributedSystem during xml parsing

-    this.myDSId =
-        this.cache.getInternalDistributedSystem().getDistributionManager().getDistributedSystemId();
+      this.myDSId = this.cache.getInternalDistributedSystem().getDistributionManager()
+          .getDistributedSystemId();
