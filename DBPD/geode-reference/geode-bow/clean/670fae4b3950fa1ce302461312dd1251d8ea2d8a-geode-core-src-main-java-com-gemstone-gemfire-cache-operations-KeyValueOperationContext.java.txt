GEODE-1463: Legacy OperationContexts do not set the appropriate Shiro
permission tuple

- Moved ResourceOperationContext into a 'public' package.
- Converted OperationContext into an interface.
- Cleaned up the hierarchy of everything that previously
  extended OperationContext.
- Marked GetOperationContext as abstract seeing that
  GetOperationContextImpl extends it and there are no uses of
  GetOperationContext anywhere. (So why does it still exist?).

-  public KeyValueOperationContext(Object key, Object value,
-      boolean isObject) {
-    super(key);
+  protected KeyValueOperationContext(OperationCode code, Object key, Object value, boolean isObject) {
+    super(code, key);
-    //this.value = value;
-    // this.isObject = isObject;
-  public KeyValueOperationContext(Object key, Object value,
-      boolean isObject, boolean postOperation) {
-    super(key, postOperation);
+  protected KeyValueOperationContext(OperationCode code, Object key, Object value, boolean isObject, boolean postOperation) {
+    super(code, key, postOperation);
-    //this.value = value;
-    //this.isObject = isObject;
