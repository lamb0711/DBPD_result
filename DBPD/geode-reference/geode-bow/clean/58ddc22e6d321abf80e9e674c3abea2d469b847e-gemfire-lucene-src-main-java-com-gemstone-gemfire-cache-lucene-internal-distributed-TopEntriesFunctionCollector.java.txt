GEODE-11: Keep results in collector unmodified

Earlier TopEntriesCollectorManager.reduce method was modifying the hits
collected in TopEntriesCollector. As a result calling getResults twice will
fail. The collected entry set needs to be preserved without making a copy.

+  private TopEntriesCollector mergedResults;
+      if (mergedResults != null) {
+        return mergedResults.getEntries();
+      }
+      
-        TopEntriesCollector finalResult = manager.reduce(subResults);
-        return finalResult.getEntries();
+        mergedResults = manager.reduce(subResults);
+        return mergedResults.getEntries();
