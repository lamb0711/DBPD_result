GEODE-7552: Break dependency on Services (#4438)

Rewrote locator installation to use Membership rather than the "hidden"
Services interface.

I rewrote some tests to stop using the internal interfaces of membership
as well, and along the way saw that JGroupsMessenger was maintaining a
collection of old identifiers that was only being consumed by a test & I
removed it.
-   * Member identifiers already used, either in this JGroupsMessenger instance
-   * or in a past one & retained through an auto-reconnect.
-   */
-  private Set<MemberIdentifier> usedMemberIdentifiers = new HashSet<>();
-
-  /**
-        usedMemberIdentifiers = oldInfo.getMembershipIdentifiers();
-  @Override
-  public boolean isOldMembershipIdentifier(MemberIdentifier id) {
-    return usedMemberIdentifiers.contains(id);
-  }
-
-    if (localAddress != null && localAddress.getVmViewId() >= 0) {
-      // keep track of old addresses that were used to successfully join the cluster
-      usedMemberIdentifiers.add(localAddress);
-    }
-    if (localAddress.getVmViewId() >= 0) {
-      // keep track of old addresses that were used to successfully join the cluster
-      usedMemberIdentifiers.add(localAddress);
-    }
-        new GMSQuorumChecker(view, services.getConfig().getLossThreshold(), this.myChannel,
-            usedMemberIdentifiers);
+        new GMSQuorumChecker(view, services.getConfig().getLossThreshold(), this.myChannel);
