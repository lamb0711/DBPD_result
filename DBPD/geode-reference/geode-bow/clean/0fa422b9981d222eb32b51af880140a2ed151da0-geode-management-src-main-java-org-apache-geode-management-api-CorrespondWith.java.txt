GEODE-6861: class renaming (#3758)

* rename RespondsWith to CorrespondsWith
* rename Response to ConfgiurationResult (as opposed to RealizationResult)
* further type ConfigurationRealizer

- * provides additional information about a restful service request beyond the minimum required in
- * {#link RestfulEndpoint}, namely the return type to expect when `list` or other operations are
- * performed
+ * provides correlation to the additional object that would be returned with the configuration
+ * to indicate runtime information.
+ * If a cache element has no additional runtime info (yet), it should be declared as
+ * implement CorrespondWith<RuntimeInfo>
-public interface RespondsWith<R> {
+public interface CorrespondWith<R extends RuntimeInfo> {
