GEODE-7720: Review javadocs, API, and code coverage for the geode-serialization module (#4607)

Added more javadocs and moved a few things into an "internal" package
under "serialization".
+/**
+ * A SerializationContext is passed to the toData() method of a DataSerializableFixedID
+ * implementation. It can be used to obtain an ObjectSerializer and determine the
+ * Geode Version of the destination of the data in cases where the SerializationVersions
+ * interface is not being used to handle backward-compatibility issues. For instance,
+ * you might decide to change a toData() method to check on the destination version
+ * and decide to omit a field that you've added in a more recent version of Geode.
+ */
