GEODE-3702 Adding a new framework for concurrency testing in geode

Added a new junit runner, ConcurrentTestRunner, for running a test that
has parallel threads.

The runner currently runs the test using Java PathFinder, which will
run the test with all interleavings of the threads.

Added an example test to geode-core for the FilterProfile serialization
logic.

There are options to configure which concurrent test runner to use, and
configuration for the JPF runner to pass jpf properties.

-import org.apache.geode.internal.offheap.annotations.Released;

+  }

+  /**
+   * used for instantiation of a profile associated with a region and not describing region filters
+   * in a different process. Do not use this method when instantiating profiles to store in
+   * distribution advisor profiles.

+  public FilterProfile(LocalRegion r, DistributedMember member, boolean hasCacheServer) {
-    this.memberID = region.getMyId();
+    this.memberID = member;
-    this.localProfile.hasCacheServer = (r.getGemFireCache().getCacheServers().size() > 0);
+    this.localProfile.hasCacheServer = hasCacheServer;
-
-    InternalDataSerializer.invokeToData(((InternalDistributedMember) memberID), out);
+    InternalDataSerializer.invokeToData(memberID, out);
