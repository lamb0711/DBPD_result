GEODE-5292: Fix memory leak for off heap regions with overflow

For a region that has been configured with off-heap storage and overflow
to disk, memory can be leaked if

- region clear
- region destroy
- region replace

all happen concurrently. The root cause appears to be region clear
modifying entries for values stored on disk without synchronizing the
entries. This prevents replace from freeing the off-heap memory for the
new value when the replace fails because the region is being destroyed.

This commit adds an integration test that uses spies on a region entry
to trigger the concurrent events during a replace operation and checks
for orphaned off-heap memory.

The proposed fix is to not modify the region entries on disk while
performing a clear operation.

-            regionEntry.removePhase2();
