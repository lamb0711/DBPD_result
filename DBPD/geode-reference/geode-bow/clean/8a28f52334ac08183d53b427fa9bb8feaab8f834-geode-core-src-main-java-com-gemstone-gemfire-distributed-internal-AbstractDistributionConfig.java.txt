GEODE-1600: startLocatorAndDS takes 0 as port number parameter

        * Use of getAvailableTCP port led to race conditions which led to locators being assigned ports in use.
        * Use of 0 now assignes a port number to the locator after the server is started.
        * Code modification to accept 0 as a valid port number until a real port number is assigned after the server is started.
	This closes #202
