GEODE-1304: remove TODO OFFHEAP comments

Tickets have been filed with the information from the removed comments.

This checkin does change LocalRegion validatedCreate/Put/Destroy
to no longer do an offheap release; instead the calling method does.

-          // TODO OFFHEAP: returns off-heap PdxInstance
-          // TODO OFFHEAP: returns off-heap PdxInstance
-        // TODO OFFHEAP MERGE: check for a cached serialized value first
-        // so we can use it instead of reading offheap
-        // If we do read offheap then add the serialize new value to the event cache
