GEODE-2787: When distribution happened, it calls startOperation() to increase a count, then call an endOperation() to decrease the count.

state flush will wait for this count to become 0.

But notifyGateway() is called after distribute(). So there's race that stateflush finished but notifyGateway has not done yet.

The fix is to move the endOperation() after callbacks.
