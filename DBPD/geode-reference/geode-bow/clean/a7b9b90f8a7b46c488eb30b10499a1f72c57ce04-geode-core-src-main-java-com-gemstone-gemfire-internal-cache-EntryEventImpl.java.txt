GEODE-915: fix FORCE_INVALIDATE_EVENT
  - new unit test ClientServerForceInvalidateDUnitTest
  - ProxyRegionMap now checks for force invalidate before it throws EntryNotFound
  - AbstractRegionMap invalidate now does force invalidate unless the region is not initialized

As part of the work also did the following code cleanup work:
1. Removed the isInvalidate parameter from shouldCreateCBEvent since this method did the exact same thing all values of this parameter.
2. Changed cacheWriteBeforeInvalidate to be serverInvalidate since all this method does is possibly send the invalidate to the server.
3. EntryEventImpl toString will now include inhibitCacheListenerNotification if it is true
4. Removed the unused parameter invokeCallbacks and forceNewEntry from serverInvalidate

+    if (inhibitCacheListenerNotification()) {
+      buf.append(";inhibitCacheListenerNotification");
+    }
