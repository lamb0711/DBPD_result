    Fix GEODE-154: HDFS region with HeapLRU reports LowMemoryExceptions
    even when region size is less then the eviction threshold

    - calling setUsageThreshold() on MemoryPoolMXBean resulted in
    it reporting incorrect memory usage causing temporary spikes.
    Since we already set CollectionThreshold at 1 byte and also have a
    stat and heap poller thread, we now skip setting the usage threshold.

-    if (testDisableMemoryUpdates) {
-      return;
-    }
-    
-    final MemoryPoolMXBean memoryPoolMXBean = getTenuredMemoryPoolMXBean();
-    final MemoryThresholds saveThresholds = this.thresholds;
-
-    if (bytesUsed < saveThresholds.getEvictionThresholdBytes()) {
-      memoryPoolMXBean.setUsageThreshold(saveThresholds.getEvictionThresholdBytes());
-    } else {
-      memoryPoolMXBean.setUsageThreshold(saveThresholds.getCriticalThresholdBytes());
-    }
