GEODE-966 HashIndex with Overflow region detection/conversion needs to occur sooner

Conversion of HashIndex to CompactRangeIndex due to overflow is determined before the create
task is created.  This prevents the index map from getting into a weird state.

+      //Hash index not supported for overflow but we "thought" we were so let's maintain backwards compatibility
+      //and create a regular compact range index instead
+      if (indexType == IndexType.HASH && isOverFlowRegion()) {
+        indexType = IndexType.FUNCTIONAL;
+      }
-      //Hash index not supported for overflow but we "thought" we were so let's maintain backwards compatibility
-      //and create a regular compact range index instead
-      if (indexType == IndexType.HASH && isOverFlowRegion()) {
-        indexType = IndexType.FUNCTIONAL;
-      }
