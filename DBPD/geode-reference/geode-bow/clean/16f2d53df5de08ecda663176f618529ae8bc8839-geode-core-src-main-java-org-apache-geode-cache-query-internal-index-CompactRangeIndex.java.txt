GEODE-4387: Removing GemFireCacheImpl.setInstanceForTests

These calls were trying to set the instance variable to a mock instance.
None of them were actually needed. Removing the method.

-      indexStore = new MemoryIndexStore(region, internalIndexStats);
+      indexStore =
+          new MemoryIndexStore(region, internalIndexStats, (InternalCache) region.getCache());
