* moved state from SimpleMemoryAllocatorImpl to FreeListManager
* refactored and cleaned up release/free code
* Removed ChunkType and ChunkFactory. They were no longer used by GemFire and complicated the code
* removed BATCH_SIZE; it was an expirement that was not longer used
* combined Chunk and GemFireChunk to the new ObjectChunk class

- * Describes the type of data stored in a chunk.
+ * Used to create AddressableMemoryChunk instances.
-public interface ChunkType {
-  /**
-   * Returns an int that describes that type of
-   * data stored in the chunk.
-   * Currently the only supported type is
-   * Chunk.SRC_TYPE_GFE.
+public interface AddressableMemoryChunkFactory {
+  /** Create and return an AddressableMemoryChunk.
+   * @throws OutOfMemoryError if the create fails
-  public int getSrcType();
+  public AddressableMemoryChunk create(int size);
