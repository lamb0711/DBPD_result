GEODE-6122: Use LogWriterLevel instead of InternalLogWriter

Use LogWriterLevel enum instead of InternalLogWriter constants.

+import static org.apache.geode.internal.logging.LogWriterLevel.SEVERE;
+
-import org.apache.geode.internal.logging.InternalLogWriter;
-      purelogWriter = new PureLogWriter(InternalLogWriter.SEVERE_LEVEL);
+      purelogWriter = new PureLogWriter(SEVERE.intLevel());
