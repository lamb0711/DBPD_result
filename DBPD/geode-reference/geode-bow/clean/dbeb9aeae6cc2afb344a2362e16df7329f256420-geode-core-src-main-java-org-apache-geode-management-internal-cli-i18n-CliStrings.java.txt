-/**-
- *  * Contains 'String' constants used as key to the Localized strings to be used
- * in classes under <code>org.apache.geode.management.internal.cli</code>
- * for Command Line Interface (CLI).
- * NOTES:
- * 1. CONVENTIONS: Defining constants for Command Name, option, argument, help:
- * 1.1 Command Name:
- *     Command name in BOLD. Multiple words separated by single underscore ('_')
- *     E.g. COMPACT_DISK_STORE
- * 1.2 Command Help Text:
- *     Command name in BOLD followed by double underscore ('__') followed by HELP
- *     in BOLD.
- *     E.g.COMPACT_DISK_STORE__HELP
- * 1.3 Command Option:
- *     Command name in BOLD followed by double underscore ('__') followed by option
- *     name in BOLD - multiple words concatenated by removing space.
- *     E.g. for option "--disk-dirs" - COMPACT_DISK_STORE__DISKDIRS
- * 1.4 Command Option Help:
- *     As mentioned in 1.3, followed by double underscore ('__') followed by HELP
- *     in BOLD.
- *     E.g. COMPACT_DISK_STORE__DISKDIRS__HELP
- * 1.5 Info/Error Message used in a command:
- *     Command name in BOLD followed by double underscore ('__') followed by MSG
- *     in BOLD followed by brief name for the message (Similar to used in LocalizedStrings).
- *     E.g. COMPACT_DISK_STORE__MSG__ERROR_WHILE_COMPACTING = "Error occurred while compacting disk store."
- * 1.6 Parameterized messages are supposed to be handled by users. It's
- *     recommended to use the same conventions as used in LocalizedStrings.
- *     E.g. COMPACT_DISK_STORE__MSG__ERROR_WHILE_COMPACTING__0 = "Error occurred while compacting disk store {0}."
