GEODE-4894: Changes are made to support case sensitivity between region, table name and pdx field, column name (#1663)

* meta-data is now used to compute the column name
* reads will now consult the pdx registry for an existing pdx type to use its field name.
* Convert field name to lowercase only when column name is uppercase.
* Table name lookup is changes to look for exact match first, than case insensitive match.
* Field to column name lookup is changed to find exact column name or case insensitive match in the metadata.

+import java.util.Set;
-   * @param fieldName
-   * @param className
+  /**
+   * Returns all the PdxTypes for the given class name.
+   * An empty set will be returned if no types exist.
+   */
+  Set<PdxType> getPdxTypesForClassName(String className);
