GEODE-539: remove XD off-heap artifacts

The OffHeapReference interface has been removed.
Use the StoredObject interface instead.

The XD SRC_TYPE constants have been renamed to
unused and a comment added explaining why we might
want to keep the SRC_TYPE/ChunkType feature around
for future off-heap extensions.

+    // The 8 bits reserved for SRC_TYPE are basically no longer used.
+    // So we could free up these 8 bits for some other use or we could
+    // keep them for future extensions.
+    // If we ever want to allocate other "types" into a chunk of off-heap
+    // memory then the SRC_TYPE would be the way to go.
+    // For example we may want to allocate the memory for the off-heap
+    // RegionEntry in off-heap memory without it being of type GFE.
+    // When it is of type GFE then it either needs to be the bytes
+    // of a byte array or it needs to be a serialized java object.
+    // For the RegionEntry we may want all the primitive fields of
+    // the entry at certain offsets in the off-heap memory so we could
+    // access them directly in native byte format (i.e. no serialization).
+    // Note that for every SRC_TYPE we should have a ChunkType subclass.
