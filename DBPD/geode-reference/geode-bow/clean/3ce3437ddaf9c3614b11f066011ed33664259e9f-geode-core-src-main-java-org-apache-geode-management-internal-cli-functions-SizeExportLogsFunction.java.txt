GEODE-2420: Enable export logs size estimation and user warning

Adds 'export logs' option, --file-limit-size, to allow user to set
maximun size of the epxorted logs zip file.

When size checking is enabled (file-limit-size > 0) then the check
will also prevent filling up the disk on each member while consolidating
and filtering the logs.

-    LOGGER.info("SizeExportLogsFunction started for member {}", member);
+    if (LOGGER.isDebugEnabled()) {
+      LOGGER.debug("SizeExportLogsFunction started for member {}", member);
+    }
