Refactoring LuceneFunction, LuceneQueryProvider, and LuceneQueryFactory

LuceneFunction had a static RepositoryManager, I changed the code to get
look up the RepositoryManager from the LuceneService.

As part of that work, I noticed StringQueryProvider really needed access
to the index to lookup the field names, analyzer, etc. So I changed the
getQuery method to take an index, and removed the unneeded string
parameters.

Finally, I removed some of the mocking from
LuceneFunctionReadPathDUnitTest, which exposed some other issues:

* I switched RepositoryManager.getRepositories back to using a
RegionFunctionContext, because apparently context.getDataSet is *not*
the local data set.

* I canonicalized the regionPaths in LuceneService

-  Collection<IndexRepository> getRepositories(Region localDataSet) throws BucketNotFoundException;
+  Collection<IndexRepository> getRepositories(RegionFunctionContext context) throws BucketNotFoundException;
