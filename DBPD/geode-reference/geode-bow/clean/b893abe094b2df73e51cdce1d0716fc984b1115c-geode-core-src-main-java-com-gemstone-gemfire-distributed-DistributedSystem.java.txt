GEODE-1329 auto-reconnect attempts cease if kicked out during boot-up of the cache

InternalDistributedSystem.reconnect() now includes cache-creation in its retry
loop and, should the cache fail to start due to a CancelException it will shut
down and try again.

While creating a new test in ReconnectDUnitTest I found problems with the
other tests in that class that I fixed.  Notably the method
getDistributedSystemProperties() wasn't returning the correct properties
for a lot of test cases because the dsProperties variable wasn't being set
by them and they were using the getCache() method.  This was causing the
current distributed system to be destroyed and a new one created with
different properties than the test wanted.  That was causing periodic
test failures.

-        while (!existingSystems.isEmpty() && existingSystemDisconnecting) {
+        boolean isReconnecting = false;
+        while (!existingSystems.isEmpty() && existingSystemDisconnecting && !isReconnecting) {
+          // a reconnecting DS will block on GemFireCache.class and a ReconnectThread
+          // holds that lock and invokes this method, so we break out of the loop
+          // if we detect this condition
+          isReconnecting = existingSystem.isReconnectingDS();
