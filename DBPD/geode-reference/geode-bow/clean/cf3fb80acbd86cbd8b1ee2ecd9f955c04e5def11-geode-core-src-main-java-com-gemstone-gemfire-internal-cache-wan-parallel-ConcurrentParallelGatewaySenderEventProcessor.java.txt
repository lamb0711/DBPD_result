GEODE-1588: AckReader and Dispatching thread are shut down before sending gateway sender close connection messages

* There was an issue where the gateway sender thread was reading off the same socket as the ack reader.
Instead, we force the ack reader thread to stop first, and close the inputstream to prevent reading garbled data
* Another issue was the ack reader thread was being spun up after being shut down.  Now we prevent the dispatching thread
from doing so by checking to see if it is being shut down.
