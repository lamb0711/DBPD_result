GEODE-1017: change off-memory from compaction to defragmentation

 Replaced references of compaction with `defragmentation`, to better
 convey the intent behind the operation.

- * If we can not find enough free memory then all the existing free memory is compacted.
+ * If we can not find enough free memory then all the existing free memory is defragmented.
