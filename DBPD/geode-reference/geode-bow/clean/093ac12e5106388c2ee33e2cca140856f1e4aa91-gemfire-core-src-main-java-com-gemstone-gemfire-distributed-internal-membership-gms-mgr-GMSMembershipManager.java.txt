fixing a possible memory leak

GMSMembershipManager thought it was destroying artifacts for shunned
members who had expired but it wasn't.

+    Set removedMembers = new HashSet();
+    
-      if (ll >= deathTime)
+      if (ll >= deathTime) {
+      }
+      
-      if (logger.isDebugEnabled())
+      if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
-    } // while
+      }
+      
+      removedMembers.add(mm);
+    }
+    // removed timed-out entries from the shunned-members collections
+    if (removedMembers.size() > 0) {
+      it = removedMembers.iterator();
+      while (it.hasNext()) {
+        InternalDistributedMember idm = (InternalDistributedMember)it.next();
+        endShun(idm);
+      }
+    }
