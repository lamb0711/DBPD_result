GEODE-6573: move methods from ConnectionManager to Connection (#3375)

Connection now has default implementations of getWrappedConnection,
activate, and passivate. ConnectionManager no longer has these methods.

+  @Override
+  public Connection getWrappedConnection() {
+    return getConnection();
+  }
+
+  @Override
-  /**
-   * @return true if connection activated, false if could not be activated because it is destroyed
-   */
+  @Override
