GEODE-7728: Fix Assertion Failures in OQL (#4639)

- Added unit and integration tests.
- Back off from the single index optimisation during join queries if
  we can't find the (single) best filter, allowing the regular
  execution to continue and use multiple indexes.
- If there are multiple indexes, add the filter evaluable operand at
  the beginning of the internal list to evaluate it first in the chain.
-    if (idxInfo == null) {
-      // Asif: This implies it is an independent condition. So evaluate it first
-      // in filter operand
+
+    // Both operands are indexed, evaluate it first in the filter operand.
+    if (idxInfo != null && idxInfo.length > 1) {
+
+    // Asif: This implies it is an independent condition. So evaluate it second in filter operand.
+    if (idxInfo == null) {
+      return 1;
+    }
+
+
+    // Key not found (indexes have mapping for UNDEFINED), evaluation is fast so do it first.
