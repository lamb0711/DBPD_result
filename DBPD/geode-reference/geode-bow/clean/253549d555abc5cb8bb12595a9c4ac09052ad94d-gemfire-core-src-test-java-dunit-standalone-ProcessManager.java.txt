corrections for GMSHealthMonitor from an impromptu code review

Engineers working on the GEODE-77 effort reviewed some of the final-check
code in GMSHealthMonitor and came up with these corrections.

This commit also includes some test clean-up that I hope will help with
GEODE-589.

-import com.gemstone.gemfire.distributed.internal.DistributionConfig;
-import com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.sequencelog.EntryLogger;
-import com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.sequencelog.SequenceLoggerImpl;
-  public static final boolean IS_WINDOWS = System.getProperty("os.name").contains("Windows");
-  
-      // use IPv4 on Windows
-      // see https://github.com/belaban/JGroups/wiki/FAQ
-//      (IS_WINDOWS?"-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true":""),
