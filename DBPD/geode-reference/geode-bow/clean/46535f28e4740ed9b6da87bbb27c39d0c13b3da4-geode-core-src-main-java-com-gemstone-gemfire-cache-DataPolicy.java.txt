GEODE-1072: Removing HDFS related code

Removing all HDFS and EvictionCriteria created code. This code will be
reinstated on a branch to be cleaned up and merged as a separate module.

- * <li><code>HDFS_PARTITION</code> in addition to <code>PARTITION</code> also causes data to be stored to HDFS. The region initialization may use the data stored on HDFS. 
-  /** Return whether this policy does persistence on HDFS.
-   * @return true if this policy does persistence on HDFS.
-   */
-  public boolean withHDFS() {
-//    return this == HDFS_PARTITION || this == HDFS_PERSISTENT_PARTITION;
-	  return false;
-  }
