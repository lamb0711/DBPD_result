GEODE-7851: Pulse refreshes expired access tokens (#4977)

If a user's access token expires, Pulse attempts to refresh it. If the
refresh fails, Pulse logs the user out and redirects the browser to
/pulse/clusterLogout.

Changes in Repository:
- When OAuth is configured, before returning the user's cluster,
  getCluster() checks whether the user's access token has expired.
- If the access token has expired, the repository attempts to refresh
  it.  If the refresh succeeds, the repository reconnects the user's
  cluster to JMX and returns it.
- If the refresh fails, the repository disconnects the user's cluster
  from JMX, removes the cluster from the repository, and throws an
  authentication or authorization exception.

Changes in PulseController:
- If the service call throws an authentication or authorization
  exception, PulseController.  getPulseUpdate() returns a 401 status.

Changes in pulsescript/common.js:
- If a Pulse ajax call returns a 401 status, ajaxPost() redirects the
  browser to /pulse/clusterLogout to log the user out and request
  re-authorization.
