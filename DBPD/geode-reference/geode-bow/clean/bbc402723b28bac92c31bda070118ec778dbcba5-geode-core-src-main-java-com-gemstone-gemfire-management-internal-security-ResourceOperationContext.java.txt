GEODE-17: change default regionName to * instead of null.

* operations with no regionName specified in its permission string will need a higher level of role than the operations with regionName specified. This makes more sense than null.

+
+  // these default values are used when creating a lock around an operation
-
-  private String regionName = null;
+  private String regionName = OperationContext.ALL_REGIONS;
+  // When only specified a resource and operation, it's assumed that you need access to all regions in order to perform the operations
+  // guarded by this ResourceOperationConext
-    this(resource, operation, null);
+    this(resource, operation, OperationContext.ALL_REGIONS);
-    //for DATA resource, when we construct the lock to guard the operations, there should always be a 3rd part (regionName),
-    // if no regionName is specified, we need to add "NULL" to it.
-    // this means, for general data operations, or operations that we can't put a regionName on yet, like backup diskstore, query data, create regions
-    // it will require DATA:READ/WRITE:NULL role
-    if(this.resource==Resource.DATA && this.regionName==null){
-      this.regionName = "NULL";
-    }
