GEODE-7213: Initialization of arrays with size 0

	* Non zero size requirement for array initialization is not a requirement post JDK6
	* Zero size is considered more efficient.
	* toArray(new T[0]) is considered faster, safer and contractually cleaner.

-      this((StatValue[]) valueList.toArray(new StatValue[valueList.size()]));
+      this((StatValue[]) valueList.toArray(new StatValue[0]));
