GEODE-7658: Removing hostname resolution from TcpSocketCreatorAdapter

We didn't need these methods on TcpSocketCreatorAdapter.
* resolveDns is based on whether network partition detection is enabled, which
we can access directly in membership.

* getHostName uses a static hostname cache that we don't need to use
for membership when creating the local address.

* getLocalHost has moved to a utility in geode-common.

-import java.net.UnknownHostException;
-import org.apache.geode.internal.inet.LocalHostUtil;
-  public InetAddress getLocalHost() throws UnknownHostException {
-    return LocalHostUtil.getLocalHost();
-  }
-
-  @Override
-  public String getHostName(final InetAddress addr) {
-    return SocketCreator.getHostName(addr);
-  }
-
-  @Override
-  @Override
-  public boolean resolveDns() {
-    return socketCreator.resolve_dns;
-  }
