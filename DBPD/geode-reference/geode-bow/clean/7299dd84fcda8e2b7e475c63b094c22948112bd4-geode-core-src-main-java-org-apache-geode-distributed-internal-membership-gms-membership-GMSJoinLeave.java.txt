GEODE-5560 member becomes coordinator but then stops when it receives a view

Upgraded the check to see if the receiver of a new membership view should
become the coordinator.  If we've received a Leave message from the coordinator
or the coordinator is scheduled to be kicked out of the system we take over
the role of coordinator if necessary.

This closes #2299

-        if (newView.shouldBeCoordinator(this.localAddress)) {

+        NetView check = new NetView(newView, newView.getViewId() + 1);
