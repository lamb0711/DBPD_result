GEODE-4675: remove checkConnected calls while notifying listeners (#1495)

A call of checkConnected ended up being made from notifyListenersMemberRemoved
which could cause it to throw DistributedSystemDisconnectedException if
the distributed system was being shutdown.
So now the distribution manager is made without this check being done.
Also change to log level from fatal to warn and improved the log message.
+  /**
+   * Like getDistributionManager but does not check
+   * that the DistributedSystem is still connected
+   */
+  private DistributionManager getDistributionManagerWithNoCheck() {
+    return getAdvisee().getSystem().getDM();
+  }
+
-        ((MembershipListener) it.next()).memberJoined(getDistributionManager(), member);
+        ((MembershipListener) it.next()).memberJoined(getDistributionManagerWithNoCheck(), member);
-        logger.fatal(
-            LocalizedMessage.create(LocalizedStrings.DistributionAdvisor_UNEXPECTED_EXCEPTION), e);
+        logger.warn("Ignoring exception during member joined listener notification", e);
-        ((MembershipListener) it.next()).memberDeparted(getDistributionManager(), member, crashed);
+        ((MembershipListener) it.next()).memberDeparted(getDistributionManagerWithNoCheck(), member,
+            crashed);
-        logger.fatal(
-            LocalizedMessage.create(LocalizedStrings.DistributionAdvisor_UNEXPECTED_EXCEPTION), e);
+        logger.warn("Ignoring exception during member departed listener notification", e);
