GEODE-841: ClientMembershipDUnitTest.testGetNotifiedClients failed

This test threw an exception when it received a client identifier with a
numeric IP address instead of a host name.  On the servers these IDs are
deserialized and a canonical host name is picked up from SocketCreator,
but this is accessing a static cache of host names that may have been
initialized during a test that turned of DNS name lookup altogether in
order to avoid network delays and possible hangs.

The fix is to just clear the cache between tests.

-  public static final StringId LonerDistributionmanager_CHANGING_PORT_FROM_TO = new StringId(2007, "Updating membership port.  Port changed from {0} to {1}.");
+  public static final StringId LonerDistributionmanager_CHANGING_PORT_FROM_TO = new StringId(2007, "Updating membership port.  Port changed from {0} to {1}.  ID is now {2}");
