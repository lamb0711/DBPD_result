GEODE-6660: Remove non-Linux OS statistics classes (#3716)

* OsStatisticsProvider.build() no longer throws IllegalStateException.
It was doing this before if the operating system name did not match
a well known one. But we want Geode to work on any OS that java supports.
The OS stats currently only work on Linux, but the build method is called
by GemFireStatSampler and we want that class to work on any OS.

* PureJavaMode.osStatsAreAvailable is marked as deprecated.
