GEODE-7939: membership heartbeat messages aren't designated high-priority

Set the heartbeat request/response messages to be high-priority so
they'll never be held up in a receive queue waiting for older messages
to be processed.

+
+  @Override
+  public boolean isHighPriority() {
+    return true;
+  }
