Fix ZipSlip bug found by LGTM.com

The unsanitized path of a zip archive entry, which may
contain '..', was used directly to resolve the destination
path for the files being unzipped.

Extracting files from a malicious archive without validating
that the destination file path is within the destination
directory can cause files outside the destination directory
to be overwritten.

-        String fileName = outputDirectoryPath + File.separator + zipEntry.getName();
+        File entryDestination = new File(outputDirectoryPath + File.separator + zipEntry.getName());
+
+        if (!entryDestination.toPath().normalize().startsWith(Paths.get(outputDirectoryPath))) {
+          throw new IOException("Zip entry contained path traversal");
+        }
-          FileUtils.forceMkdir(new File(fileName));
+          FileUtils.forceMkdir(entryDestination);
-        File entryDestination = new File(fileName);
