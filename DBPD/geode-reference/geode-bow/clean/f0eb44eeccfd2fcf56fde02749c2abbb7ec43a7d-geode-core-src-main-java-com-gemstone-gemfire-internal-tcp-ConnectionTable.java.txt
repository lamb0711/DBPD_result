GEODE-1755 Clean up TODOs in membership, communications and serialization components

-        // TODO we only schedule unordered shared cnxs for timeout
-        // if we own sockets. This seems wrong. We should
-        // be willing to time them out even if we don't own sockets.
-    // ct.close(); // TODO implementing this is a quagmire, but not necessary,
-    //                since recusing from JGroups takes care of our obligations
-    //                to our peers.
