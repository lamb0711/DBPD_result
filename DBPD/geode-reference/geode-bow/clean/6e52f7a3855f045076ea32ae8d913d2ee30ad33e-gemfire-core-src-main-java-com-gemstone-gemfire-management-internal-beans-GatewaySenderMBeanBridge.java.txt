GEODE-681: Measuring event queue size without using the stat for gfsh

The eventQueueSize stat has issues with concurrent events during start
and stop that are leading it to be inaccurate. To make gfsh and jmx
correct,  measuring the queue size directly from the underlying region
size.

Adding unit tests for the size methods.

-  
-  public GatewaySenderMBeanBridge() {
-    this.monitor = new MBeanStatsMonitor(
-        ManagementStrings.GATEWAY_SENDER_MONITOR.toLocalizedString());
-    initializeStats();
-  }
-    return getStatistic(StatsKey.GATEWAYSENDER_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE).intValue();
+    return abstractSender.getEventQueueSize();
