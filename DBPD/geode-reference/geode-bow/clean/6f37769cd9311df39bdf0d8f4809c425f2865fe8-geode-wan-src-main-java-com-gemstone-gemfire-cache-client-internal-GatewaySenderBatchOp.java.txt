GEODE-1241: Fixed the misspelt names in Geode WAN module

	* CamelCased few names which were not camelCased
	* Spelling errors were fixed.
	* Improvements are still required in variable names - using meaningful names.

-    AbstractOp op = null;
-    //System.out.println("Version: "+con.getWanSiteVersion());
-    // [sumedh] both cases are now same; why switch-case?
-    if (Version.GFE_651.compareTo(con.getWanSiteVersion()) >= 0) {
-      op = new GatewaySenderGFEBatchOpImpl();
-    } else {
-      // Default should create a batch of server version (ACCEPTOR.VERSION)
-      op = new GatewaySenderGFEBatchOpImpl();
-    }
+    AbstractOp op = new GatewaySenderGFEBatchOpImpl();
