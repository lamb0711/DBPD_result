GEODE-6303 Membership gets confused by multiple locators being specified by gfsh

Added canonicalization of locator addresses so that duplicate
entries in the "locators" setting are ignored.

-        logger.info("state after looking for membership coordinator is {}", state);
+        logger.info("Discovery state after looking for membership coordinator is {}",
+            state);
+    if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
+      logger.debug("Parsed locators are {}", locators);
+    }
