GEODE-5276: fix entries stats from going negative (#2033)

Entries was going negative during a transaction because:
* When txApplyDestroy was adding a new entry that would be a TOMBSTONE; it was setting the value of the new entry initially to Token.DESTROYED. This was wrong. It should have waited to set this until later when it knew it was in "tokenMode".
* When makeTombstone was later called it did a check to see if the entry was new. It based this in the value being Token.REMOVE_PHASE1. Since it was not (it was DESTROYED) this prevented it from doing a corrective inc of the stat to prevent it from going negative.

So the fix is the use REMOVE_PHASE1 during initialization and to only set the value of the new entry to DESTROYED if we are in tokenMode.
-        // TODO: if inTokenMode then Token.DESTROYED is ok but what about !inTokenMode because
-        // owner.concurrencyChecksEnabled? In that case we do not want a DESTROYED token.
-        RegionEntry newRe = getEntryFactory().createEntry(owner, key, Token.DESTROYED);
+        RegionEntry newRe = getEntryFactory().createEntry(owner, key, Token.REMOVED_PHASE1);
-              // already has value set to Token.DESTROYED
+                } else {
+                  newRe.setValue(owner, Token.DESTROYED);
