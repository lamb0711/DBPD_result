GEODE-719: Processing errors in cache.xml do not log a warning

- Catch all Errors and RuntimeExceptions while creating a cache and log
an error level message.
- Display the cache.xml contents before trying to initialize the cache
so that the errors have a better context.
- Converted some exception messages to i18n.
