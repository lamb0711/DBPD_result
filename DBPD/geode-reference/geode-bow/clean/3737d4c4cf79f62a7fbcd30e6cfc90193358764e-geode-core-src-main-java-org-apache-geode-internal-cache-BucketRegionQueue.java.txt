GEODE-6246: Forced super.basicDestroy to be called during sender queue initialization


-          destroyKey(key);
+          // The destroyKey method is called with forceBasicDestroy set to true since containsKey
+          // can be true even though get on the key returns null. That happens when the
+          // ParallelQueueRemovalMessage destroys the entry first. In that case, when this method is
+          // invoked, the raw value is the DESTROYED token. This was causing the
+          // EntryNotFoundException to be thrown by basicDestroy. The forceBasicDestroy boolean set
+          // to true forces the super.basicDestroy call to be made instead of the
+          // EntryNotFoundException to be thrown.
+          destroyKey(key, true);
