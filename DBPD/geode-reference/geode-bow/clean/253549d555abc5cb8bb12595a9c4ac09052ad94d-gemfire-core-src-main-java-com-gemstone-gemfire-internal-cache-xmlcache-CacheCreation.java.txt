corrections for GMSHealthMonitor from an impromptu code review

Engineers working on the GEODE-77 effort reviewed some of the final-check
code in GMSHealthMonitor and came up with these corrections.

This commit also includes some test clean-up that I hope will help with
GEODE-589.

+  
+  /** clear thread locals that may have been set by previous uses of CacheCreation */
+  public static void clearThreadLocals() {
+    createInProgress = new ThreadLocal<>();
+  }
-  private static final ThreadLocal createInProgress = new ThreadLocal();
+  private static ThreadLocal createInProgress = new ThreadLocal();
