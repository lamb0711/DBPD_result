GEODE-6492: Ensure that starting HttpService can fail gracefully in the face of errors (#3275)

- If the HttpService (or war deployment) fails, simply log a warning
  message and continue.
- Add a simple gradle building test which ensures that 'geode-core' is
  the only module required to start a basic Cache.
