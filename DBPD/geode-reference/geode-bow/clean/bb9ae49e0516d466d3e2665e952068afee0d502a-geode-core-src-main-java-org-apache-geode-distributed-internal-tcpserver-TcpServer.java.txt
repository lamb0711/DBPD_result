GEODE-4229 CI failure due to suspect string: "Locator socket was closed unexpectedly"

Removing error-level log message that was added during this cleanup
for GEODE-4176.

The server socket is closed as a matter of course in processing a
shutdown request, so we shouldn't consider this condition to be an
error.

-        log.error("Locator socket was closed unexpectedly - server thread is exiting.");
