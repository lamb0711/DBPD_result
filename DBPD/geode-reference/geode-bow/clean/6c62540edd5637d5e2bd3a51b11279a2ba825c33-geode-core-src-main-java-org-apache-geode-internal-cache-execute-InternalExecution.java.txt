* Extensions and implementations of Execution and ResultCollector and the 
classes and interfaces involved in the execution chain were lacking the
ability to apply Generic types.
* Typing issues starting from MemberConfigManager.java class were fixed.
* Trivial IDE warnings were fixed.
-public interface InternalExecution extends Execution {
+public interface InternalExecution<ArgumentT, ReturnT, AggregatorT>
+    extends Execution<ArgumentT, ReturnT, AggregatorT> {
-  InternalExecution withMemberMappedArgument(MemberMappedArgument argument);
+  InternalExecution<ArgumentT, ReturnT, AggregatorT> withMemberMappedArgument(
+      MemberMappedArgument argument);
-  InternalExecution withBucketFilter(Set<Integer> bucketIDs);
+  InternalExecution<ArgumentT, ReturnT, AggregatorT> withBucketFilter(Set<Integer> bucketIDs);
