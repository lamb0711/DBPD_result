GEODE-291: Prevent stderr noise from com.gemstone.gemfire.test.process

Change classes in com.gemstone.gemfire.test.process package:

* Remove unused methods and variables..

* Change waitFor() to match the Process.waitFor(long, TimeUnit) method in
JDK 1.8. Pass in timeout parameters from ProcessWrapper instead of
hardcoding it.

* Separate waitFor() into waitFor(long, TimeUnit) and start(). Previously
waitFor() was performing both of these actions.

* Improve debugging by: 1) adding minor lifecycle to ProcessOutputReader,
2) include command string in stack trace of ProcessStreamReader. This
enabled identification of the source of unwanted stderr output.

Change DistributedSystem to enable testing:

* Change DistributedSystem to enable better unit testing by allowing tests
to provide different locations for gemfire.properties with
gemfirePropertyFile. Make same changes for gfsecurity.properties and
gemfireSecurityPropertyFile.

* Create unit and integration tests for DistributedSystem class.

Change tests that use com.gemstone.gemfire.test.process package:

* Use DistributedSystem.PROPERTIES_FILE_PROPERTY to override location of
gemfire.properties.

* Separate integration tests from UnitTest files to IntegrationTests.

* Add and use Catch-Exception for better unit testing.

* Remove unused code and class.

+          properties.load(AbstractLauncher.class.getResourceAsStream(DistributedSystem.getPropertiesFile()));
