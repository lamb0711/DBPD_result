GEODE-4819: Separating authorization out from protobuf handlers (#1674)

Separating out authentication from the logic of parsing protobuf
messages. All region operations should be done through the new
AuthenticatingCache API, which does authentication and the operation.

In a future change we should move AuthenticationCache to the core and
refactor gfsh, the REST API, and the old client to also go through this
layer.

+import java.util.Collection;
-    Set<Region<?, ?>> regions = messageExecutionContext.getCache().rootRegions();
+
+    Collection<String> regions = messageExecutionContext.getAuthorizingCache().getRegionNames();
-    for (Region region : regions) {
-      builder.addRegions(region.getName());
-    }
+    regions.forEach(builder::addRegions);
