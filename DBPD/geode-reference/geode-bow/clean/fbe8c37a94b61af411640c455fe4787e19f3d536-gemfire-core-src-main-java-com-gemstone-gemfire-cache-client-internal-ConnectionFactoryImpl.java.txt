GEODE-397: Fix clients to use server ssl config

Each client pool now creates a single SocketCreator that
uses either the server or gateway ssl config.
That SocketCreator is used for all connections the client
makes to the server. It no longer uses the default cluster
SocketCreator when connecting to the server.
This fix might show some performance improvement because the
old code recreated the SocketCreator every time the client
created a server connection. Now it just happens once for each
pool.

Also since using SocketCreator.getDefaultInstance when it should
have used a non-default instance caused this bug all calls of
getDefaultInstance were reviewed. A number of them used
to call isHostReachable which is a method that was deadcoded.
So all those calls have been removed. One of call of
getDefaultInstance was deleted (in ConnectionTable) because it
was never used.

The existing code CacheServerSSLConnectionDUnit is now named
CacheServerSSLConnectionDUnitTest which causes this test to
be run with the other unit tests. A test for this bug was
added to it.
