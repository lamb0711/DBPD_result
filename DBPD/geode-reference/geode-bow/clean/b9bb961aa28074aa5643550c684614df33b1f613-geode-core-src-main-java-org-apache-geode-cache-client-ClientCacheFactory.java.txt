GEODE-5081 ClientCacheFactory is missing the setPoolSubscriptionTimeoutMultiplier()

Added the missing method & a test for it

This closes #1804

+   * A server has an inactivity monitor that ensures a message is sent to a client at least once a
+   * minute (60,000 milliseconds). If a subscription timeout multipler is set in the client it
+   * enables timing out of the subscription feed with failover to another server.
+   * <p>
+   * The client will time out it's subscription connection after a number of seconds equal to this
+   * multiplier times the server's subscription-timeout.
+   * <p>
+   * Set this to 2 or more to make sure the client will receive pings from the server before the
+   * timeout.
+   * <p>
+   * A value of zero (the default) disables timeouts
+   * <p>
+   * The resulting timeout will be multiplied by 1.25 in order to avoid race conditions with the
+   * server sending its "ping" message.
