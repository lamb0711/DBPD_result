Adding a couple of simple junit tests for FileSystem

Testing some basic file write and read operations, as well as file
renames and deletes.

I also added some more javadocs to the filesystem classes and moved them
into a separate package.

-package com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.lucene.internal;
+package com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.lucene.internal.filesystem;
-final public class File implements Serializable {
+/**
+ * A file that is stored in a gemfire region.
+ */
+public class File implements Serializable {
-  String name;
+  private String name;
+  /**
+   * Get an input stream that reads from the beginning the file
+   * 
+   * The input stream is not threadsafe
+   */
+  /**
+   * Get an output stream that appends to the end
+   * of the file.
+   */
