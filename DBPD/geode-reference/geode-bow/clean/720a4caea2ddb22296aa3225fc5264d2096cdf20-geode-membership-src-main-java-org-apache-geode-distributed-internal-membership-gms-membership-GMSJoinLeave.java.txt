GEODE-8241: Locator observes locator-wait-time (#5236)

In the case where a locator starts up and is unable to connect to any
other locators, it may decide to become the membership coordinator even
if locator-wait-time has not elapsed.

This change addresses this issue by requiring a locator to wait for
locator-wait-time before deciding to become the coordinator.
