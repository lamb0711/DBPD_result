GEODE-5787: deleted deprecated RepeatableRunnable (#2522)



-import org.awaitility.Awaitility;
-   * Invokes the {@code run} method of a {@link Runnable} in this {@code VM}. If the invocation
-   * throws AssertionError, and repeatTimeoutMs is >0, the {@code run} method is invoked repeatedly
-   * until it either succeeds, or repeatTimeoutMs has passed. The AssertionError is thrown back to
-   * the sender of this method if {@code run} has not completed successfully before repeatTimeoutMs
-   * has passed.
-   *
-   * @deprecated Please use {@link Awaitility} to await condition and then
-   *             {@link #invoke(SerializableCallableIF)} instead.
