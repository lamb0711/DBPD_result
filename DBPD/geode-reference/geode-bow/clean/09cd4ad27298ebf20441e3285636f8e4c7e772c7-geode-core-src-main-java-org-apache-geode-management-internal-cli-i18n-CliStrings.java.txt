GEODE-1128: Add missing regions to the missing-disk-stores command

Refactored “show missing-disk-stores command” and added a section to the
output to show missing colocated regions. Corrected messages in
LocalizedStrings, change “gemfire list-missing-disk-stores” to
“gfsh show missing-disk-stores”. Added new command function class to gather
both missing disk-store and missing colocated region information on a
distributed system member.

Parameterized show missing-disk-store error message.

Added new DataSerializable class for sending missing colocated region
results to gfsh command.

Refactored ColocationLogger. Class originally deferred updating the list
of missing colocated children (i.e. removing regions from the missing
list that are now present) for a region until the next logging
interval. This has been changed to update the list on-demand, whenever
getMissingChildRegions() is called.

Added DUnit test for new functionality in show missing-disk-store
command.

Added JUnit tests for new classes

This closes #244

+  public static final String SHOW_MISSING_DISK_STORE__ERROR_MESSAGE = "An error occurred while showing missing disk stores and missing colocated regions: %1$s";
