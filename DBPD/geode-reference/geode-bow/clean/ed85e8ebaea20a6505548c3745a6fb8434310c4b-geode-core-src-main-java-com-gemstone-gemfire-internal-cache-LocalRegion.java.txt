GEODE-1714: fix disk stats

A number of places were found that did not correctly
change the DiskRegionStats: entriesInVM and entriesOnlyOnDisk.
Also found places that did not correctly change
the entry count and size of a PR bucket region.
EntriesInVM is supposed to only count entries that have a value
stored in the JVM. But it was also counting invalid entries.
Since invalid entries do not have a value this stat no longer counts them.

+  public int testHookGetValuesInVM() {
+    int result = 0;
+    for (RegionEntry re: getRegionMap().regionEntries()) {
+      if (re.getValueAsToken() == Token.NOT_A_TOKEN) {
+        result++;
+      }
+    }
+    return result;
+  }
+  
+  public int testHookGetValuesOnDisk() {
+    int result = 0;
+    for (RegionEntry re: getRegionMap().regionEntries()) {
+      if (re.getValueAsToken() == null) {
+        result++;
+      }
+    }
+    return result;
+  }
+
