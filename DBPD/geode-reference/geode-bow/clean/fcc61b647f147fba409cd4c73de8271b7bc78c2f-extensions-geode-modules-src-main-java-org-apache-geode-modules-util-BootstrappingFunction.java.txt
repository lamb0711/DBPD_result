GEODE-6011: Prevent synchronization using strings and boolean (#2807)

* Locking is now achieved using reentrant locks as they are more fair than synchronization.

+import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;
+  private static final ReentrantLock registerFunctionLock = new ReentrantLock();
-    synchronized (ID) {
+    registerFunctionLock.lock();
+    try {
+    } finally {
+      registerFunctionLock.unlock();
