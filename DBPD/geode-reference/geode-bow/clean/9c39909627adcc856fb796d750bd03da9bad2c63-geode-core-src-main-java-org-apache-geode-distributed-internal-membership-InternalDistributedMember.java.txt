GEODE-6883 refactor GMS classes

refactoring to remove references to InternalDistributedMember or
DistributionMessage in "gms" packages caused failures when
multicast is enabled on Regions.

Queued messages received during startup have partial sender identifiers
and these need to have their isPartial bit set correctly so they won't
be treated as full identifiers.

-    if (netMbr.getHostName() == null) {
+    if (netMbr.getHostName() == null || netMbr.isPartial()) {
-    this.isPartial = false;
+    this.isPartial = m.isPartial();
