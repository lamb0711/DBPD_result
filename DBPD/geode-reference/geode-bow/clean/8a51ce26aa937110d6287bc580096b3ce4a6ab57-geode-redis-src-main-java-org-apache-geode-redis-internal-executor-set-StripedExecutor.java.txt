GEODE-8098: Refactor CommandFunction (#5082)

* CommandFunction code is now cleaner.
* Added SingleResultRedisFunction and a new ResultCollector class
to simplify and ensure that our function only has a single result.
* StripedExecutor has been simplified to only take a Callable

-import java.util.function.Consumer;
-   * the given callable by invoking "call" on it and then passing
-   * the result of "call" to "accept" on the given consumer.
-   * Concurrent calls of this method for the same stripe will invoke their callables sequentially.
+   * the given callable by invoking "call" on it and then returning the result.
-   * @param resultConsumer is given the result of the callable.
-  public <T> void execute(Object stripeId,
-      Callable<T> callable,
-      Consumer<T> resultConsumer);
+  public <T> T execute(Object stripeId,
+      Callable<T> callable);
