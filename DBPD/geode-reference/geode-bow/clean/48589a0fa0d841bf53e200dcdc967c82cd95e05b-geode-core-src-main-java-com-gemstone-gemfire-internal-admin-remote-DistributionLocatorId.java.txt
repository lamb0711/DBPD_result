GEODE-1810: WAN locator exchange doesn't include hostname-for-clients if it is set

While exchanging locators, DistributionLocatorID will be constructed
using hostNameforClients. It looks like this was happening if an
embedded locator was started using the start-locator distributed system
property, but not for any other case.

Adding a test that we actually send the hostname for clients to remote
locators.

+    this(port, bindAddress, null);

+  
+  public DistributionLocatorId(int port, String bindAddress, String hostnameForClients) {
+    this.hostnameForClients = hostnameForClients;
-          // if bindAddress then use that instead of host...
-          if (this.bindAddress != null && this.bindAddress.length() > 0) {
+          // If hostnameForClients is set, use that
+          if (this.hostnameForClients != null && this.hostnameForClients.length() > 0) {
+            sb.append(this.hostnameForClients);
+          } else if (this.bindAddress != null && this.bindAddress.length() > 0) {
+            // if bindAddress then use that instead of host...
