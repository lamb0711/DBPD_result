GEODE-5424: Adding a spotless rule to enforce using GeodeAwaitility

Any tests that use regular awaitility will now fail the spotless check,
to avoid checking tests that don't pick up our default wait time.

-import org.awaitility.Awaitility;
- * Utility to set consistent defaults for {@link Awaitility} calls for all geode tests
+ * Utility to set consistent defaults for {@link org.awaitility.Awaitility} calls for all geode
+ * tests
-   * @see Awaitility#await()
+   * @see org.awaitility.Awaitility#await()
-   * @see Awaitility#await(String)
+   * @see org.awaitility.Awaitility#await(String)
-    return Awaitility.await(alias)
+    return org.awaitility.Awaitility.await(alias)
