GEODE-83 Add support for Redis AUTH command
Also added Geode property "redis-password" so the authentication password can be set by xml or through GFSH

+  public static final String ERROR_NO_PASS = "Attempting to authenticate when no password has been set";
+  public static final String ERROR_INVALID_PWD = "Attemping to authenticate with an invalid password";
+  public static final String ERROR_NOT_AUTH = "Must authenticate before sending any requests";
+    public static final String AUTH =           "The wrong number of arguments or syntax was provided, the format for the AUTH command is \"AUTH password\"";
