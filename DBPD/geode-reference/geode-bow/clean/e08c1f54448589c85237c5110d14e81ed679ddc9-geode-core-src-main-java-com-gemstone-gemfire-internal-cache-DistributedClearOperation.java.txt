GEODE-599: fix clear with concurrent writes

Cache modification lock was being released before operation distribution to other members.
This provided a small window in which an operation from another thread could update the
region prior to the other members receiving notification (i.e. down leveled)

This closes #232

-          region.lockLocallyForClear(dm, this.getSender());
+          region.lockLocallyForClear(dm, this.getSender(), event);
