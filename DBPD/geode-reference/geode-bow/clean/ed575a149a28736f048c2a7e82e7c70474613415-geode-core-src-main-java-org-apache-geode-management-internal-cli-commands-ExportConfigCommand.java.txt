GEODE-5011: Require all ResultModel sections to be explicitly named (#1944)


- Remove the auto-indexed naming inherited from the previous implementation.
- Remove section named "error"
- When using createError, the section will just be named "info", however the
  state will be set to ERROR.
-    InfoResultModel infoData = crm.addInfo();
+    InfoResultModel infoData = crm.addInfo(ResultModel.INFO_SECTION);
