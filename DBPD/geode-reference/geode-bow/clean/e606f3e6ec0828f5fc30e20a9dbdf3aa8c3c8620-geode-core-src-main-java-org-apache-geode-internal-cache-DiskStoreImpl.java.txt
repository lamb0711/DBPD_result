GEODE-1672: Disabled recovering values for LRU region during startup.

When recovering persistent files, system stores the values in temp
maps (for regions) using a background thread, as these maps are not
actual regions, the temp-regions are  not considered/included for
LRU eviction, which causes the system to run OOM.

The problem is fixed by skipping recovering  values for LRU regions.

A new system property ""disk.recoverLruValues" is added to support
reading values for lru regions.

+
+  /**
+   * Allows recovering values for LRU regions. By default values are not recovered for LRU regions
+   * during recovery.
+   */
+  public static final String RECOVER_LRU_VALUES_PROPERTY_NAME =
+      DistributionConfig.GEMFIRE_PREFIX + "disk.recoverLruValues";
+
+  final boolean RECOVER_LRU_VALUES =
+      getBoolean(DiskStoreImpl.RECOVER_LRU_VALUES_PROPERTY_NAME, false);
