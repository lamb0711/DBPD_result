GEODE-7479: Change Membership interface to use MemberIdentifier interface (#4420)

Changing all classes in Membership to be parameterized by an ID type,
which extends MemberIdentifier. This allows core to create a membership
system that manages InternalDistributedMember objects in a type safe
way.

Removing all uses of InternalDistributedMember, DistributedMember, and
friends from within the membership code.

-public class SuspectRequest {
-  final MemberIdentifier suspectMember;
+public class SuspectRequest<ID extends MemberIdentifier> {
+  final ID suspectMember;
-  public SuspectRequest(MemberIdentifier m, String r) {
+  public SuspectRequest(ID m, String r) {
-  public MemberIdentifier getSuspectMember() {
+  public ID getSuspectMember() {
-    SuspectRequest other = (SuspectRequest) obj;
+    SuspectRequest<ID> other = (SuspectRequest<ID>) obj;
