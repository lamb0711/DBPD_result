GEODE-857: Fix data race in SystemFailureJUnit

The SystemFailure class was storing state in a static var without
ensuring thread-safe reads and writes. This was causing intermittent
test failures. Fixed the data race and set the flag correctly as a
test precondition.

-  private static boolean isCacheClosing = false;
+  private static volatile boolean isCacheClosing = false;
