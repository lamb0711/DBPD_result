- * The instances of this class will be used for distributing Lucene Query objects and re-constructing the Query object.
- * If necessary the implementation needs to take care of serializing and de-serializing Lucene Query object. Geode
- * respects the DataSerializable contract to provide optimal object serialization. For instance,
