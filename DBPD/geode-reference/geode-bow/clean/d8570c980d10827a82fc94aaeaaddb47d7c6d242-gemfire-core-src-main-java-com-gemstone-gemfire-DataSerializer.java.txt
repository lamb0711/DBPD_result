GEODE-324: defer deserialization of old value in PR put

When a PR put returns the old value our internal messages were deserializing
the values before we get back to the user thread that initiated the operation.
If a thread local class loader is used for the class we need to load during
deserialization then the early deserialization will fail.

Now the deserialization is delayed until the serialized old value gets through
our messaging layer and back to the thread that performed the pr put.

Added junit tests that verify that both PutReplyMessage classes no longer
deserialize their old value.

-     // if( ( !(obj instanceof ByteSource) || ((StoredObject) obj).isSerialized())) {
+      if (obj instanceof StoredObject) {
+        StoredObject so = (StoredObject)obj;
+        if (logger.isTraceEnabled(LogMarker.SERIALIZER)) {
+          logger.trace(LogMarker.SERIALIZER, "writeObjectAsByteArray StoredObject");
+        }
+        so.sendAsByteArray(out);
+        return;
+      } else {
-     // }
+      }
