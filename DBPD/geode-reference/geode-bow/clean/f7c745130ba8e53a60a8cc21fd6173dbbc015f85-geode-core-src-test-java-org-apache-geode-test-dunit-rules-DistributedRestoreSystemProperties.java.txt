GEODE-4693: fix JDBCLoader on non-object pdx fields (#1517)

If the region mapping has a pdxClassName then the JdbcLoader will look for a pdx type that is already defined and use its field types when creating the PdxInstance. If the pdx type does not have a field that corresponds to an existing column then an exception is thrown.

A pdx field of type "char" or an instance of "java.lang.Character" will be sent to SQL as a String of size 1.
A pdx field of type "Date" will be sent to SQL as a java.sql.Timestamp.

A new external API was added to GemFireCache. It is the method "registerPdxMetaData".
It only needs to be called on clients if they are going to do reads using a JdbcLoader of data that wa s not written using the JdbcWriter or JdbcAsyncWriter.
-          setProperties(new Properties(originalProperties));
+          setProperties(copyOf(originalProperties));
+  private Properties copyOf(Properties source) {
+    Properties copy = new Properties();
+    copy.putAll(source);
+    return copy;
+  }
