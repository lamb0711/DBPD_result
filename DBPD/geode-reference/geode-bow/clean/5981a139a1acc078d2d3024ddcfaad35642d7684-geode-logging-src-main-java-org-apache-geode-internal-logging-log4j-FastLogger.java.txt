GEODE-7177: Logging as a submodule (#4129)

* GEODE-7177: Extract LogService to a separate submodule

- Extracting LogService and it's dependencies to a separate geode-logging
submodule so that other modules not in geode-core can still use LogService to
get a Logger.

- Removing the use of the logging SPI from LogService
LogService had a dependency on the logging SPI in geode-core. However, this
dependency was unecessary - the LoggingProvider loaded statically in this class
never had `configure` called on it. In addition, the getLogger methods of this
class are merely creating FastLoggers which can live inside geode-logging and
do not need to be pluggable.

- Moved executors that are not dependent on geode-core to geode-logging and
renamed the remaining executors to be CoreLoggingExecutors.

- Refactor the marker interface from Loggable to EntriesCollection

- EntriesCollection put back into internal.cache and AbstractRegion now implements the marker
- Formerly known as Loggable renamed to LogWithToString

- Remove marker interface called EntriesCollection completely, replace with LogWithToString.
