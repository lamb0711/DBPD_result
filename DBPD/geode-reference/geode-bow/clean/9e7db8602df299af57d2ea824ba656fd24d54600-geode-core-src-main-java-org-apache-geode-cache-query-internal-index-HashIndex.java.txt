GEODE-5433: Indexes are updated with the correct old value from gii (#2142)

* Modified logic for indexing in initialImagePut to use the correct new vs old
* Cleaning up indexes that early aborted in gii due to tombstones
* Optimized index removal to not have to find old key when cleaning up gii tombstones
* Refactor initialImagePut, slightly reduce complexity
