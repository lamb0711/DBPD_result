GEODE-8240: Member Identifier Future Versions

Inability of member identifiers to hold future versions caused 
problems in rolling upgrades. Now member identifiers hang on 
to a VersionOrdinal which is a base type for Version "enum".
-   * If the remote peer to which this input/output is connected has a lower version that this
-   * member, then this returns the {@link Version} of the peer else null. If the peer has a
-   * higher
-   * {@link Version}, then this member cannot do any adjustment to serialization and its the remote
-   * peer's responsibility to adjust the serialization/deserialization according to this peer.
+   * If the remote peer to which this input/output is connected has a version ordinal
+   * for which a {@link Version} is known (locally) then that {@link Version} is returned,
+   * otherwise null is returned.
+   *
+   * If the peer has a version ordinal for which no {@link Version} is locally known,
+   * then this member cannot do any adjustment to serialization and it's the remote
+   * peer's responsibility to adjust the serialization/deserialization according to
+   * this peer.
