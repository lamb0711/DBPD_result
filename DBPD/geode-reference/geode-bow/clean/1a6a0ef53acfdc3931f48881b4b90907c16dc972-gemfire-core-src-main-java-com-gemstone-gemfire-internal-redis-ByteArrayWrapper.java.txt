Fix for GEODE-109

1) To fix this floating meta data problem for the redis list implementation, this meta data has been moved into the list region itself
2) Sorted set query failures are fixed by using fully qualified names and also depends on GEODE-146
3) Concurrent region creation/destruction logic completely changed to use dedicated locks for synchronization, fixed distributed deadlock
4) Added integration tests
5) Add javadocs where necessary

This closes #13
