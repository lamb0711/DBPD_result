GEODE-1391 Update javadocs for JSONFormatter

+import java.math.BigDecimal;
-
- * PdxFormatter class has static methods to convert JSON document into {@link PdxInstance}
- * and methods to convert back {@link PdxInstance} into JSON Document.
+ * PdxFormatter class has static method {@link JSONFormatter#fromJSON(String)} to convert JSON 
+ * document into a {@link PdxInstance} and static method {@link JSONFormatter#toJSON(PdxInstance)} 
+ * to convert back {@link PdxInstance} into a JSON Document.
- * Using this, application can put json document in gemfire cache. Application can define indexes 
- * on PdxInsatnce and then query those using OQL. Query will return the PdxInstances as results,
- * that needs to convert back into JSON document.
