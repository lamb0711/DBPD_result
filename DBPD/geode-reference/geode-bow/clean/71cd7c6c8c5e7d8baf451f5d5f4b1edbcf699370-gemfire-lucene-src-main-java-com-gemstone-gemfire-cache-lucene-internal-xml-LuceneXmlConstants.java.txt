Making lucene indexed fields their own XML element.

Rather than <lucene:index fields="x,y"> fields are now listed as their
own individual elements, for example

<lucene:index>
  <lucene:field name="x"/>
</lucene:index>

-  public static final String FIELDS = "fields";
+  public static final String FIELD = "field";
