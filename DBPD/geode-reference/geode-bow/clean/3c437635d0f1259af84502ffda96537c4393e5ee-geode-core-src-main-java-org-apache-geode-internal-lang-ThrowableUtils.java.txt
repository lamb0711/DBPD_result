Don't make an exception it's own cause in generateCancelledException

In some race condition, we were passing and exception that has
disconnectCause already as it's cause to generateCancelledException.
That caused java to throw an IllegalStateException. Avoiding that
possibility.

+
+  /**
+   * Set the root cause of an exception, if possible, to be newRootCause
+   */
+  public static void setRootCause(Throwable exception, Throwable newRootCause) {
+    Throwable nt = exception;
+    while (nt.getCause() != null) {
+      nt = nt.getCause();
+    }
+
+    // Don't try to set something as it's own cause
+    if (nt == newRootCause) {
+      return;
+    }
+
+    nt.initCause(newRootCause);
+  }
+
