GEODE-3249 Validate internal client/server messages

The addition of USER_CREDENTIAL_MESSAGE in ServerConnection.isInternalMessage
caused problems for the c++ client.  This message class does require
credentials and shouldn't be included in the set of internal messages.

(cherry picked from commit f2492bf0abdc662cc080f1e2c0f17257e05604a3)

-        || messageType == MessageType.USER_CREDENTIAL_MESSAGE
