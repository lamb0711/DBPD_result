GEODE-6488: Migrating cancellation state to execution context (#3322)

This work solves two problems.  One is that the query cancellation task
reference in DefaultQuery could be overwritten and thus never removed
from monitoring upon successful completion of a query.  Second is that
once a query execution timed out once, the query object was in an
unusable state which is undesirable.

The solution is to attach the cancellation state to the execution
context rather than the query object, so that cancellation is associated
with each independent execution of a query rather than having
cancellation state that applies to the entire query object.
+    this.cqQueryContext = ((DefaultQuery) query).isCqQuery();
-  public void setCqQueryContext(boolean cqQuery) {
-    this.cqQueryContext = cqQuery;
-  }

-  @Override
