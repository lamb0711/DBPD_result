GEODE-7479: Change Membership interface to use MemberIdentifier interface (#4420)

Changing all classes in Membership to be parameterized by an ID type,
which extends MemberIdentifier. This allows core to create a membership
system that manages InternalDistributedMember objects in a type safe
way.

Removing all uses of InternalDistributedMember, DistributedMember, and
friends from within the membership code.

-public class SuspectMember {
+public class SuspectMember<ID extends MemberIdentifier> {
-  public MemberIdentifier whoSuspected;
+  public ID whoSuspected;
-  public MemberIdentifier suspectedMember;
+  public ID suspectedMember;
-  public SuspectMember(MemberIdentifier whoSuspected,
-      MemberIdentifier suspectedMember, String reason) {
+  public SuspectMember(ID whoSuspected,
+      ID suspectedMember, String reason) {
-    return this.suspectedMember.equals(((SuspectMember) other).suspectedMember);
+    return this.suspectedMember.equals(((SuspectMember<ID>) other).suspectedMember);
