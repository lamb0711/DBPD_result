GEODE-871: build-up of sockets in TIME_WAIT on locator machine

This change-set alters the client to abort its TCP/IP connection to
the locator by enabling SO_LINGER and setting the timeout to zero
before it closes the connection.  The Locator closes its connection
first, which puts it into TIME_WAIT.  The client then aborts the
connection, which cleans up the Locator's TIME_WAIT connection.

-            output.close();
-          // Normal path closes input first, so let's do that here...
-          if (input != null) {
-            try {
-              input.close();
-            } catch (IOException e) {
-              log.warn(
-                "Exception closing input stream", e);
-            }
-          }

-          // Closing the ObjectInputStream is supposed to close
-          // the underlying InputStream, but we do it here just for
-          // good measure. Closing a closed socket is a no-op.
-            log.warn(
-                "Exception closing socket", e);
