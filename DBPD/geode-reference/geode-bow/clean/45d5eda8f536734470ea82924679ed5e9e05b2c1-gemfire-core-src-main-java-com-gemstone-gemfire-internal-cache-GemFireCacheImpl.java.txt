GEODE-787: MemoryIndexStore needs unit tests

Minor refactoring and adding of unit tests
Long term plan is to remove the reference to the cache

+  
+  /* Used for testing, retain the old instance in the test and re-set the value when test completes*/
+  public static GemFireCacheImpl setInstanceForTests(GemFireCacheImpl cache) {
+    GemFireCacheImpl oldInstance = instance;
+	  instance = cache;
+	  return oldInstance;
+  }
