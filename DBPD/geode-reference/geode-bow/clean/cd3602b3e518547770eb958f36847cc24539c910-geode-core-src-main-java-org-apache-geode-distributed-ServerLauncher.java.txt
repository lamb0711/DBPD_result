GEODE-5877: Make multithreaded test single-threaded

Rewrite ServerLauncherWaitOnServerTest to be single-threaded. Instead of
using a second thread to signal the termination conditions, we signal
the conditions by mocking collaborators.

Add tests for other conditions that cause waitOnServer() to exit.

Remove MultiThreadedTC library.
