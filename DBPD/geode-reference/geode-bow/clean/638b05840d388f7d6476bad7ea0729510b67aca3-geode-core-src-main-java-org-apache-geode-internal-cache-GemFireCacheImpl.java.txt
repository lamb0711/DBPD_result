GEODE-2155 Auto-reconnect fails with NPE

I created a test to reproduce the problem by introducing a non-Declarable
cache listener and then initiating a forced-disconnect.  cache.xml is
generated and when it's used to rebuild the cache a CacheXmlException
is thrown, reliably reproducing the problem.

The fix is to simply catch the CacheXmlException in
InternalDistributedSystem.reconnect() and terminate reconnection attempt

+    if (c == null) {
+      return null;
+    }
