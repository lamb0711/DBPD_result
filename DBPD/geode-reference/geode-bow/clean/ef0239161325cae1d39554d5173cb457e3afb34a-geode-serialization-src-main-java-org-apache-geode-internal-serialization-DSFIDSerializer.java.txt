GEODE-7720: Review javadocs, API, and code coverage for the geode-serialization module (#4607)

Added more javadocs and moved a few things into an "internal" package
under "serialization".
+/**
+ * A DSFIDSerializer is a serialization service that is able to serialize
+ * and deserialize objects whose classes have been registered with it
+ * using registerDSFID(). During serialization a DataSerializableFixedID
+ * implementation will have its toData() method invoked and during deserialization
+ * it will have its fromData() method invoked.
+ * <p>
+ * Use DSFIDSerializerFactory to construct a serialization service.
+ */
