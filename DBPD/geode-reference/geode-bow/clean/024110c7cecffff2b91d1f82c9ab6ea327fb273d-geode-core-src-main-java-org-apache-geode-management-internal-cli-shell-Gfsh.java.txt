GEODE-4613: always redirect jdk loggers to file no matter what mode Gfsh is in. (#1424)


-      // redirect Internal Java Loggers Now
-      // When run with shell, this is done on connection. See 'connect' command.
-      redirectInternalJavaLoggers();
-      // AbstractShell.logger - we don't want it to log on screen
+      // Only in headless mode, we do not want Gfsh's logger logs on screen
+    // we want to direct internal JDK logging to file in either mode
+    redirectInternalJavaLoggers();
+  /**
+   * This method sets the parent of all loggers whose name starts with "java" or "javax" to
+   * LogWrapper.
+   *
+   * logWrapper disables any parents's log handler, and only logs to the file if specified. This
+   * would prevent JDK's logging show up in the console
