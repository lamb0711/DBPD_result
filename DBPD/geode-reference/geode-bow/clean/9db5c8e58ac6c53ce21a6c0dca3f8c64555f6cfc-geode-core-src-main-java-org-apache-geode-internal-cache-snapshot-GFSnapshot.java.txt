GEODE-2971: Introduce ExitCode to resolve inconsistency of shell exit values.

* this closes #652

* Corrected inconsistency of error handling and subsequent exit status in member status commands
* 'gfsh help' now returns 0 exit code as base behavior (previously returned 1).

+import org.apache.geode.internal.ExitCode;
-      System.exit(1);
+      ExitCode.FATAL.doSystemExit();
