GEODE-945: Importing javax.transaction packages to fix javadoc

Javadoc was spitting out class not found warnings. It looks like it had
some trouble locating these classes, even though they are on the
classpath. Changing the class to import the packages seems to fix the
javadoc task.

+import javax.transaction.Status;
+import javax.transaction.Transaction;
+import javax.transaction.UserTransaction;
+
- * @see javax.transaction.UserTransaction#setRollbackOnly
- * @see javax.transaction.Transaction#registerSynchronization
- * @see javax.transaction.Status
+ * @see UserTransaction#setRollbackOnly
+ * @see Transaction#registerSynchronization
+ * @see Status
