GEODE-7479: Change Membership interface to use MemberIdentifier interface (#4420)

Changing all classes in Membership to be parameterized by an ID type,
which extends MemberIdentifier. This allows core to create a membership
system that manages InternalDistributedMember objects in a type safe
way.

Removing all uses of InternalDistributedMember, DistributedMember, and
friends from within the membership code.

+import org.apache.geode.internal.serialization.Version;
+  /**
+   * Get the Geode version of this member
+   */
+  Version getVersionObject();
+
+  /**
+   * Replace the current member data with the given member data. This can be used to fill out a
+   * MemberIdentifier that was created from a partial data created by readEssentialData.
+   *
+   * @param memberData the replacement member data
+   */
+  void setMemberData(MemberData memberData);
+
+  void setIsPartial(boolean b);
+
+  /**
+   * An InternalDistributedMember created for a test or via readEssentialData will be a Partial ID,
+   * possibly not having ancillary info like "name".
+   *
+   * @return true if this is a partial ID
+   */
+  boolean isPartial();
