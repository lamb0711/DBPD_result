enabling multicast communications and fixing a locator auto-restart problem.
This disables the use of multicast for discovery and all tests that were
doing that have been changed to use locators.

- * distributed system are located.  This discovery can be performed
- * using either IP multicast (default) or by contacting "locators"
- * running on a given host and port.  All connections that are
- * configured to use the same multicast address/port and the same
+ * distributed system are located.  This discovery is performed
+ * by contacting "locators"
+ * running on a given host and port.  All DistributedSystems that are
+ * configured to use the same same
- *   If zero, then multicast will be disabled and locators must be used to find the other members
- *   of the distributed system.
- *   If "mcast-port" is zero and "locators" is ""
- *   then this distributed system will be isolated from all other GemFire
- *   processes.
+ *   If zero, then multicast will be disabled and unicast messaging will
+ *   be used.
- *   <dd><U>Default</U>: "0" if locators is not ""; otherwise "10334"</dd>
