GEODE-3041 DistributedMemberDUnitTest.testGroupsInAllVMs fails intermittently

When shutting down the MembershipManager after it has joined we should not
use uncleanShutdown because the member will appear to have crashed.
Instead we should do a normal shutdown.

-  public void disconnect(boolean duringStartup) {
+  public void disconnect(boolean beforeJoined) {
-    logger.debug("DistributionChannel disconnecting with " + membershipManager + "; duringStartup="
-        + duringStartup);
+    logger.debug("DistributionChannel disconnecting with " + membershipManager + "; beforeJoined="
+        + beforeJoined);
-      if (duringStartup) {
+      if (beforeJoined) {
