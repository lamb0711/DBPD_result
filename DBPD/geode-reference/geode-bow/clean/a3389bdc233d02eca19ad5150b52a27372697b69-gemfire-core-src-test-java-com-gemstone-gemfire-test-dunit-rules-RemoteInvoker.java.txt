Changing SerializableRunnableIF to throw exception from run

This makes writing tests easier, it will get converted to an unchecked
exception.

Adding throws Exception to some tests that invoked run directory on
SerializableRunnable.

-    runnable.run();
+    try {
+      runnable.run();
+    } catch (Exception e) {
+      throw new RuntimeException(e);
+    }
