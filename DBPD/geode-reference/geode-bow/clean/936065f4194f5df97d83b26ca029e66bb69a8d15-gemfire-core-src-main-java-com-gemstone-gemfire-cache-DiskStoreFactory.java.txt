GEODE-229: Fixed javadoc for DiskStoreFactory.setCompactionThreshold

The javadocs and the behavior of the code were backwards. The code
compacts when the live data gets below the threshold. I changed the
javadocs to avoid screwing up someone who was relied on the old
behavior.

Adding a unit test of this property.

-   * Sets the threshold at which an oplog will become compactable. Until it reaches
-   * this threshold the oplog will not be compacted.
-   * The threshold is a percentage in the range 0..100.
-   * When the amount of garbage in an oplog exceeds this percentage then when a compaction
-   * is done this garbage will be cleaned up freeing up disk space. Garbage is created by
