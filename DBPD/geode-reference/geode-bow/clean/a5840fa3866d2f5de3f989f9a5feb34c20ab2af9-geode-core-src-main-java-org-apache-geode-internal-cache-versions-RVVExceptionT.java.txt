GEODE-5559: Improve runtime of RegionVersionHolder.canonicalExceptions (#2298)

This modifies the RVVException to iterate over the received version newest to
oldest, which makes generating the canonical exceptions much more
straightforward.


-import org.apache.geode.internal.cache.versions.RVVException.ReceivedVersionsIterator;
-    for (ReceivedVersionsIterator it = receivedVersionsIterator(); it.hasNext();) {
+    for (ReceivedVersionsReverseIterator it = receivedVersionsReverseIterator(); it.hasNext();) {
-    for (ReceivedVersionsIterator it = ex.receivedVersionsIterator(); it.hasNext();) {
+    for (ReceivedVersionsReverseIterator it = ex.receivedVersionsReverseIterator(); it.hasNext();) {
-  public ReceivedVersionsIterator receivedVersionsIterator() {
-    ReceivedVersionsIteratorT result = new ReceivedVersionsIteratorT();
-    result.initForForwardIteration();
-    return result;
+  public ReceivedVersionsReverseIterator receivedVersionsReverseIterator() {
+    return new ReceivedVersionsReverseIteratorT();
