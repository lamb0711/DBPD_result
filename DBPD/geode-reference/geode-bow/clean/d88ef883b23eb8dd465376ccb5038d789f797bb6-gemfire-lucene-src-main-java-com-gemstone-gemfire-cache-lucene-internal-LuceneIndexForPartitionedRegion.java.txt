Hiding the lucene async event queue from the list of queues.

I added a new flag to the queue - isMetaQueue, which controls whether a
queue will show up in getAllQueues. This also has the effect of
preventing the queue from showing up in a generated xml file.

This is necessary because our queue needs to be constructed with an
async event listener that has a reference to the index. If the queue is
generated and added to the xml, it will end up trying to create a
listener before the index is created.

+import com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.RegionFactory;
+import com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.asyncqueue.internal.AsyncEventQueueFactoryImpl;
+import com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.cache.InternalRegionArguments;
+import com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.cache.RegionFactoryImpl;
-      AsyncEventQueueFactory factory = cache.createAsyncEventQueueFactory();
+      AsyncEventQueueFactoryImpl factory = (AsyncEventQueueFactoryImpl) cache.createAsyncEventQueueFactory();
+      factory.setIsMetaQueue(true);
