Changing how PartitionRepositoryManager handles destroyed buckets

This class was using a weak hash map with BucketRegions as keys. Instead
of that, use the bucket id as the key. I added support to
IndexRepository for the repository to indicate if the underlying
BucketRegion has been destroyed. If the IndexRepository is destroyed, we
will create a new IndexRepository in PartitionRepositoryManager.

+import com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.Region;
+  private Region<?,?> region;
-  public IndexRepositoryImpl(IndexWriter writer, LuceneSerializer serializer) throws IOException {
+  public IndexRepositoryImpl(Region<?,?> region, IndexWriter writer, LuceneSerializer serializer) throws IOException {
+    this.region = region;
-  
-  
+
+  @Override
+  public boolean isClosed() {
+    return region.isDestroyed();
+  }
