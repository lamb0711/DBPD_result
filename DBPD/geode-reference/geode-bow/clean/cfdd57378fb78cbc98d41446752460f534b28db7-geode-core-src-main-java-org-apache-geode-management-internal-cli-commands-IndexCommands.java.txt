 - Extract utility methods into their own classes.
 - Rename AbstractCommandsSupport to GfshCommand, and convert it from an abstract class to an interface

-public class IndexCommands extends AbstractCommandsSupport {
+public class IndexCommands implements GfshCommand {
-  @Override
-  protected Set<DistributedMember> getMembers(final InternalCache cache) {
-    // TODO determine what this does (as it is untested and unmockable!)
-    return CliUtil.getAllMembers(cache);
-  }
