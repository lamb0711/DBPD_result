GEODE-5013 Replace org.json with Jackson in GfJsonObject

This removes org.json as a dependency in geode-core and associated test
modules.  GfJsonObject and GfJsonArray are ported to use the same basic
Jackson ObjectMapper setup as QueryResultFormatter so that we now have a
uniform mechanism for managing JSON documents for querying/gfsh and
folks can use Jackson annotations like @JsonIgnore on their classes.

The geode-web-api and geode-pulse modules still use the geode-json
module in tests.  When/if they are ported to use GfJsonObject/Array we can delete
the geode-json module.

+import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode;
+
-    Integer code = (Integer) contentObject.get(ERROR_CODE);
+    JsonNode code = contentObject.get(ERROR_CODE);
-    return code;
+    return code.asInt();
