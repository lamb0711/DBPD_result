GEODE-1037 CI failure: PdxClientServerDUnitTest.testNonPersistentServerRestart

Altered the test to make sure the client cache knows that the server has
shut down prior to restarting the server.  This ensures that the listener
is invoked and clears the PDX type registry.

This commit also includes some code clean-up in PDX and the client pool.

-    this.lonerPort = newPort;
-    this.getId().setPort(this.lonerPort);
+    this.lonerPort = newPort;
+    this.getId().setPort(this.lonerPort);
