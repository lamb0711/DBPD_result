         * If all the servers are above the 1.6.0 version then the LuceneIndexCreationInProgressException will be propogated up to the servers
	* If there are servers which are lower than 1.6.0 then get repository will be re-executed but it will wait till the indexes are available.
+   * Returns a collection of {@link IndexRepository} instances hosting index data of the input list
+   * of bucket ids. The bucket needs to be present on this member.
+   *
+   * The method will wait till the index is ready to be used if the waitOnRetry boolean is set to
+   * true
+   *
+   * @return a collection of {@link IndexRepository} instances
+   * @throws BucketNotFoundException if any of the requested buckets is not found on this member
