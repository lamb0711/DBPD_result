GEODE-7503: Block Cache.close() until everything is disconnected (#4963)

Subsequent calls to GemFireCacheImpl close will now block until the
first call to close completes instead of returning from early-outs.

Use boolean argument to skip await if cache close is invoked from
the DisconnectListener in InternalLocator.

Additional changes:
* Make cache close reentrant
* Fixup GemFireCacheImplCloseTest flakiness
* Remove unused class

+      final boolean keepAlive, final boolean keepDS, boolean skipAwait) {
