GEODE-6122: Use LogWriterLevel instead of InternalLogWriter

Use LogWriterLevel enum instead of InternalLogWriter constants.

+import static org.apache.geode.internal.logging.LogWriterLevel.ALL;
-      LocalLogWriter tempLogger = new LocalLogWriter(InternalLogWriter.ALL_LEVEL, pw);
+      LocalLogWriter tempLogger = new LocalLogWriter(ALL.intLevel(), pw);
