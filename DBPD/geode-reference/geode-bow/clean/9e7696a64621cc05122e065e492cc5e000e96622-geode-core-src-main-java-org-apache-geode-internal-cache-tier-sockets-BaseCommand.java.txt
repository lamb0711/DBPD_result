GEODE-2860: Refactor use of EventTracker

  * change EventTracker to an interface with two implementations
  * move as much logic out of LocalRegion down into subclasses that
    make use EventTracker
  * move and refactor static inner classes in EventTracker into own
    class files
  * migrate some of event-focused classes into a new sub package
  * add tests for existing logic from EventTracker

This closes #638
