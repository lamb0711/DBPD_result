GEODE-2536: Remove the inappropriate implementation of methods in DiskId for persistent regions.

markForWriting and unmarkForWriting should not be used for persistent region.
needsToBeWritten always return false now for persistent region, as the diskEntry either is being written to disk (sync) or sheduled to be written to disk (async)

+      // GEODE-2535 fix should address the original #39989 negative keyId issue.
