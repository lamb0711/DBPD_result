* refactor AlterRegionCommand to use ResultModel and RegionConfig
* only alter region in the same group as the region is created on
* when cluster configuration is enabled, if region does not exist in CC, the command would error out.
* The command would no longer alter region not created by gfsh command
* add more unit tests

+ * This represents a key/value pair, name is the key, another string or object is the value
