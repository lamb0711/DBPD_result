GEODE-77: installing initial view

The membership manager was not installing the initial view into the
DistributionManager.  This was causing its waitForViewInstallation method
to hang if the view in question was the member's initial view

+        NetView initialView = services.getJoinLeave().getView();
+        latestView = new NetView(initialView, initialView.getViewId());
+        listener.viewInstalled(latestView);
+
