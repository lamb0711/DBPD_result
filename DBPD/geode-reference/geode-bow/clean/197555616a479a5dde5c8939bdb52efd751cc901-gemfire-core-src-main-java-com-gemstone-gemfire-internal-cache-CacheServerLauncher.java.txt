GEODE-965: redundant cache server created during auto-reconnect

If cluster configuration is enabled but a cache.xml is actually being
used to construct the cache then it is possible that after an auto-
reconnect a redundant CacheServer will be created.

There is an assumption made in writing the auto-reconnect code that if
cluster-configuration is enabled the cache will not be constructed
using a cache.xml file.

This change-set marks CacheServers that are created by gfsh or so
called "default" servers created by cache.xml processing so that
auto-reconnect will know whether they should be handled specially.

+      CacheServerHelper.setIsDefaultServer(server);
