GEODE-907: Switch all fields from floats to doubles

- This is because when Jackson serializes a float (to JSON) it does so
  through an implicit cast to a double which alters the precision.
  Practically, a number like 23.99F ends up being 23.98999999234D which
  messes with unit tests and displaying in the UI.

-      pauses.add(obj.toString());
+      if (obj instanceof Number) {
+        pauses.add(((Number) obj).longValue());
+      }
