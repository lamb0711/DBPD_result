GEODE-6272: change jdbc to use pdx as keys instead of json (#3076)

Composite keys for the jdbc connector must now be PdxInstances created with "neverDeserialize".

* added PdxInstanceFactory.neverDeserialize and PdxInstance.isDeserializable as new external APIs.

* improved the InternalPdxInstance interface to include Sendable.
Also this interface is now implemented by the pdx enum classes.
So now all classes that implement PdxInstance also implement InternalPdxInstance

* getCacheObject is now on the InternalPdxInstance interface.

* getRawField is now in the InternalPdxInstance interface.
A method that was on PdxInstanceImpl but only used by AttributeDescriptor
and that did not use any PdxInstanceImpl data is now on AttributeDescriptor.
This also got rid of a singleton lookup of the cache.

* removed unused FieldNotFoundInPdxVersion

* removed PdxFieldNotFoundException

+   * If this instance is one that never deserializes then getObject returns "this".
-   * @return the deserialized domain object.
+   * @return the deserialized domain object or "this" if this instance never deserializes
+
+  /**
+   * Returns false if this instance will never be deserialized to a domain class.
+   * Instances that never deserialize can be created using
+   * {@link PdxInstanceFactory#neverDeserialize}.
+   *
+   * @return false if this instance will never be deserialized to a domain class.
+   *
+   * @since Geode 1.9
