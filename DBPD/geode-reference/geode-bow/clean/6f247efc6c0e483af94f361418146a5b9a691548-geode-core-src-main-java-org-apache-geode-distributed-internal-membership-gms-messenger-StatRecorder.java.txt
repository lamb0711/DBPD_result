GEODE-7479: Change Membership interface to use MemberIdentifier interface (#4420)

Changing all classes in Membership to be parameterized by an ID type,
which extends MemberIdentifier. This allows core to create a membership
system that manages InternalDistributedMember objects in a type safe
way.

Removing all uses of InternalDistributedMember, DistributedMember, and
friends from within the membership code.

+import org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.membership.gms.api.MemberIdentifier;
-public class StatRecorder extends Protocol {
+public class StatRecorder<ID extends MemberIdentifier> extends Protocol {
-  Services services;
+  Services<ID> services;
-  public void setServices(Services services) {
+  public void setServices(Services<ID> services) {
