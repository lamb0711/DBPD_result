GEODE-1543: Change the log level from error to info

    * When multiple peers join the cluster conncurrently, only the first one that joins will distribute the index creation and other will try to create the index locally because of the distributed message and then log an error afterwards.
    * This is an expected behaviour and hence should not be logged as error but rather as a info.

    This closes #156
