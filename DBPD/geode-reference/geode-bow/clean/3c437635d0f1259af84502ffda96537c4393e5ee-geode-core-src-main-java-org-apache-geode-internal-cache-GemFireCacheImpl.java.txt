Don't make an exception it's own cause in generateCancelledException

In some race condition, we were passing and exception that has
disconnectCause already as it's cause to generateCancelledException.
That caused java to throw an IllegalStateException. Avoiding that
possibility.

+import org.apache.geode.internal.lang.ThrowableUtils;
-      Throwable nt = throwable;
-      while (nt.getCause() != null) {
-        nt = nt.getCause();
-      }
-        nt.initCause(GemFireCacheImpl.this.disconnectCause);
+        ThrowableUtils.setRootCause(throwable, GemFireCacheImpl.this.disconnectCause);
