GEODE-7487: Update Running CQ Context (#4369)

- Added unit and integration tests.
- Implemented method to invalidate the cache used by CQs.
- Updated the context implementation to change the internal
  MethodInvocationAuthorizer used whenever the CQ resets the
  ExecutionContext.
- Added a warning message whenever the MethodInvocationAuthorizer 
  returned by the QueryConfigurationService is null.
+   * Invalidates the internal cache containing the keys that are part of the CQ query results.
+   * Once this method finishes, the CQ engine will not apply the internal optimization for already
+   * seen keys anymore, not until the cache is manually rebuilt.
+   */
+  void invalidateCqResultKeys();
