GEODE-5596 Client ends up with destroyed entry after invalidate()

Modifying client cache behavior to create an Invalid entry when an application
invokes invalid() and the entry is currently in Destroyed state on the client
but not on servers.

I also changed the AttributesFactory javadoc for
concurrency-checks-enabled because it was saying it is turned off by
default but that is not the case.

-    basicInvalidate(event, invokeCallbacks, false);
+    final boolean forceNewEntryInClientCache = this.serverRegionProxy != null
+        && getConcurrencyChecksEnabled();
+    basicInvalidate(event, invokeCallbacks, forceNewEntryInClientCache);
