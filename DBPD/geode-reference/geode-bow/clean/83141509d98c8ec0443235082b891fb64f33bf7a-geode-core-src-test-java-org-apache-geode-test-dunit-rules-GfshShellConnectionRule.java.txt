refactor ServerStarterRule and LocatorStarterRule so that they can be created without a Properties first.

- * Class which eases the connection to the jmxManager {@link ConnectionConfiguration} it allows for
- * the creation of per-test connections with different user/password combinations, or no username
- * and password
+ * Class which eases the connection to the locator/jmxManager in Gfsh shell and execute gfsh
+ * commands.
+ *
+ * if used with {@link ConnectionConfiguration}, you will need to specify a port number when
+ * constructing this rule. Then this rule will do auto connect for you before running your test.
+ *
+ * otherwise, you can call connect with the specific port number yourself in your test. This rules
+ * handles closing your connection and gfsh instance.
-    // do not connect if no port initialized
+    // do not auto connect if no port initialized
+    // do not auto connect if it's not used with ConnectionConfiguration
-      connect(port, portType);
