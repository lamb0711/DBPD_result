GEODE-2088: Correctly throw TransactionDataRebalancedException when bucket is moved during rebalance.

Turns out the transaction layer code has already handled when to throw TransactionDataNotColocatedException in getTransactionException method call in TXStateProxyImpl by checking whether the key is colocated with the keys already touched in the transaction. Only need to make sure that piece of code will be executed by throwing correct TransactionException.

+            TransactionException ex = new TransactionDataRebalancedException(
+                LocalizedStrings.PartitionedRegion_TRANSACTIONAL_DATA_MOVED_DUE_TO_REBALANCING
