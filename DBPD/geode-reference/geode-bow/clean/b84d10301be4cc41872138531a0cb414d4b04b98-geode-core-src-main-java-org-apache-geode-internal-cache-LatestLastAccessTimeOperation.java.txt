GEODE-4933: Include members with NORMAL and PRELOADED data policy in â€¦ (#1676)

* GEODE-4933: Include members with NORMAL and PRELOADED data policy in expiration

  * If the data policy for a replicate region is PRELOADED, for example, if
    eviction is used and local destroy is the eviction action, that member was
    being excluded from the set of members to get last access time before
    expiration. Those members are now included.

  * Members that were caching proxies, thus having the NORMAL data policy,
    were also being excluded and are not included in the last access time
    lookup.
