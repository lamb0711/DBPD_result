GEODE-494: remove failing test

This test fails very intermittently but doesn't reflect any real-world
use case so I'm deleting it.

While debugging, found a logic error in PartitionManager but it seems
that the code path is never exercised (used only in tests).

-            createdBucket = createBucket(self, region, bucketId, destroyExistingRemote);
+            createdBucket = createBucket(self, region, bucketId, destroyExistingLocal);
