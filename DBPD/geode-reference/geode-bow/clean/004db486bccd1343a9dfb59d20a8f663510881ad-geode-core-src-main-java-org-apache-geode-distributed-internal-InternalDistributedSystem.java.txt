GEODE-6475: Adding isDisconnected() method to InternalDistributedSystem

+  /*
+   * This method was introduced so we can deterministically query whether the distributed
+   * system has fully disconnected or not. The isConnected() method will return false if a
+   * disconnection/cancellation is in progress, so it does not provide a reliable way to
+   * query if the distributed system is fully disconnected or not.
