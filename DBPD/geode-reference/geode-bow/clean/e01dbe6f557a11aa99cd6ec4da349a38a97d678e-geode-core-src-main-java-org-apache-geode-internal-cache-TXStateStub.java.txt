GEODE-2091: Do not return false when containsValueForKey call failed in a transaction

Correctly handle exception to fail the transaction instead of returning null.
Add check for colocated buckets so that correct TrasactionException can be thrown.
Fix containsKey method call as well.
Add test cases in dunit test.
