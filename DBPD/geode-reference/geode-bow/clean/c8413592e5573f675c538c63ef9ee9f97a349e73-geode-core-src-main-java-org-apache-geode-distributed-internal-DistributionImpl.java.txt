* GEODE-7727: modify sender thread to detect relese of connection

* GEODE-7727: Update solution only for shared connections

* GEODE-7727: added test

* GEODE-7727: update ater comments

* GEODE-7727: update test

* GEODE-7727: fix for async write hanging

* GEODE-7727: Test of region operations in the face of closed connections

Adding a test for what happens to region operations when a connection is closed
out from under the system. This test hangs without the changes to let the
reader thread keep running.

Fix to test

* GEODE-7727: Preventing a double release of the input buffer

The releaseInputBuffer method was not thread safe. If it is called
concurrently, it will end up being released twice, which will add the buffer to
to the buffer pool twice. Later, this could result in two threads using the
same buffer, resulting in corruption of the buffer.

With the changes for GEODE-7727, we made it likely that releaseInputBuffer
would be called concurrently. If a member departs, one thread will call
Connection.close. Connection.close will close the socket and call
releaseInputBuffer. However, closing the socket will wake up the reader thread,
which will also call releaseInputBuffer concurrently.

Making releaseInputBuffer thread safe by introducing a lock.

* GEODE-7727: update after merge

* GEODE-7727: update test name
