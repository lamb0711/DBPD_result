GEODE-5464: Generify DistributionManager and related classes

* Augment various collections to use generics
* Inline some iterator loops that were trivially "foreach" loops
* remove unused code
* Inline some redundant local variables
* make some methods more private
* change some tests to use `InternalDistributedMember` instead of
  `DistributedMember`.
* Make ThrottlingMemLinkedQueueWithDMStats generic and use atomic.
