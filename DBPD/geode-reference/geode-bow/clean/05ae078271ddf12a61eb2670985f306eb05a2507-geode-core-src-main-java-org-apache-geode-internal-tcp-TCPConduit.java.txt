* GEODE-5817: Restrict default membership range to not conflict with default ports

Currently the default range for membership ports is 1024-65535.  This results
in occasional failures where a random membership port selection will conflict
with the default server or locator port when using all default values.

This change modifies the default range to 41000-61000.  In addition to not
conflicting with any of the default ports (highest is 40404), this is also a
proper subset of the default Linux ephemeral port range (32768-61000).

Also, improving some logging when failing to connect to a locator.
-  private int[] tcpPortRange = new int[] {1024, 65535};
+  private int[] tcpPortRange = new int[] {DistributionConfig.DEFAULT_MEMBERSHIP_PORT_RANGE[0],
+      DistributionConfig.DEFAULT_MEMBERSHIP_PORT_RANGE[1]};
