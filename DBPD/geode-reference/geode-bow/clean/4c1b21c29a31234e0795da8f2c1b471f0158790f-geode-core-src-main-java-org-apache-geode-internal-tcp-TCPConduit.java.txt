GEODE-7456: Moving GMSMembershipManager into gms package (#4313)

Adding a Distribution class that ClusterDistributionManager and the
rest of geode-core uses, which wraps GMSMembershipManager. Moving
GMSMembershipManager into the gms package and renaming to MembershipImpl.

Distribution now owns the DirectChannel, rather than MembershipImpl.

Removing the MembershipManager interface and replacing uses of it with the
Membership interface.

* Added an ArchUnitTest for geode-core to only use Distribution to access Membership.
