GEODE-2730: Refactor ServerStarterRule and LocatorStarterRule

- Introduced LocalServerStarterRule and LocalLocatorStarterRule to eventually replace LocatorStarterRule and ServerStarterRule.
- The new rules will *only* start a member through the rule's before() method.  Members will *never* be started on Rule instantiation.
- The new rules are backed by Builders that use AvailablePort.Keeper to reserve the ports that a member will use when it eventually starts.  The Keepers are released just before starting the member, with the goal of minimizing test flakiness caused by BindExceptions when a port is already in use.

+      this.hostName = "localhost";
+      this.port = locatorStarterRule.getHttpPort();
+    }
