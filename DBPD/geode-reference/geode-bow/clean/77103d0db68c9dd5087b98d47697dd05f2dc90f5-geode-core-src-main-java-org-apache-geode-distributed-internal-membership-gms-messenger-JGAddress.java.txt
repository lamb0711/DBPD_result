GEODE-7358: Membership code should use InternalDistributedMember as the membership identifier (#4230)

* GEODE-7358: Membership code should use InternalDistributedMember as the membership identifier

Initial refactor: removal of NetMember, MemberAttributes and other classes that subordinated GMS
identifiers.  Repurposing GMSMember as a data packet to hold information required in a membership
identifer.

* fixing failing tests

* fixing failing unit tests

* picking up a change that IntelliJ didn't auto-save & fixing serializables test

* fixing problems with durable client ids

these identifiers morph after the client's membership identifier has been formed
so the member ID needs to be updated before serializing it

* fixing merge error

* updating sanctionedDataSerializables

* fixing lgtm complaint

* removing unnecessary serialization/deserialization methods in GMSUtil

* remove methods no longer needed for serializing an object with a different DSFID

* fixing serializables test
