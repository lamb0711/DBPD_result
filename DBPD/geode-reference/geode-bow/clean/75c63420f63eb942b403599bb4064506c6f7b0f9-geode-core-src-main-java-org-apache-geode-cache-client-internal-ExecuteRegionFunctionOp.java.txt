GEODE-7184: Add function execution timers (#4135)

- Add micrometer timers for recording function executions
- Refactor FunctionStats and FunctionServiceStats
- Change static fields to instance fields on FunctionStatsManager
- Mark static field as @Immutable on NoopMeterRegistry
- Rename FunctionServiceStats.endFunctionExecutionWithElapsedTime to
distinguish it from FunctionStats.endFunctionExecution which takes a
start time.
- Remove extra call to FunctionStats.getTime() in
MemberFunctionStreamingMessage and add boolean to prevent calling
endFunctionExecutionWithException before startFunctionExecution was
called.
- Remove FunctionStats.getTime() in favor of returning the time from
FunctionStats.startFunctionExecution()

Functions with hasResult()=false execute asynchronously on an executor.
Previously, the instrumentation code recorded a successful function
execution after submitting a function to an executor, which is incorrect
because the function has not necessarily executed at that point. Now, we
record the execution time only after the function actually executes.
