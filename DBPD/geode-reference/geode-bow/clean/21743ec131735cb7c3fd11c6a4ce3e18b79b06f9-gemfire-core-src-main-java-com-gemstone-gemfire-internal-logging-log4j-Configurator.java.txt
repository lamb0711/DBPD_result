GEODE-189: Configure Log4J 2 using classpath instead of system property

Rename log4j2-default.xml to log4j2.xml. Move log4j2.xml and
log4j2-cli.xml to the root of the gemfire-core JAR file. By default
Log4J 2 will find and use the log4j2.xml in the JAR file unless the
user places a custom config file earlier in the classpath or specifies
the log4j.configurationFile system property.

The new JGroups JAR also contains log4j2.xml in its root, so we need to
ensure that gemfire-core JAR is on the classpath before JGroups.

Upgrade System-Rules JUnit library to 1.12.1.

+import org.apache.logging.log4j.core.config.ConfigurationSource;
+  public static String getConfigurationSourceLocation(final Configuration config) {
+    return config.getConfigurationSource().getLocation();
+  }
