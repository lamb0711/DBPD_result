GEODE-6013: Use expected initial image requester's rvv information (#2857)

Re-submitting after fixing NPE from previous checkin.

Made changes to use the expected initial image requester's rvv
information instead of the image provider's local rvv while
determining full or delta GII.

There was logical error where it was using provider's local
exception(rvv) instead of using requester's local exception(rvv).
This could result in performing Delta GII instead of Full GII.
