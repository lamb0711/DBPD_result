GEODE-6244 Healthy member kicked out by sick member

- do not allow membership manager suspect initiation to kick out a
member on the first failed check
- perform a self-health check before sending SuspectRequest messages
- consider members who have sent shutdown messages as gone when
performing "should I become coordinator" checks in GMSHealthMonitor
- modified the membership view installed by GMSJoinLeave to be immutable
so it isn't inadvertently changes

    fixes for unit test hang

    - remove suspect from members-in-final-check collection and initiate
    both remote and local suspect processing
    - renamed "final check" to "availability check" since it isn't
    necessarily a "final" check
    - perform a self-check before telling others to check a suspect

    leave the member unsuspected after final check fails

    If the final check fails and we're not going to remove the suspect from
    the distributed system we need to leave it in an "unsuspected" state
    locally so that the background monitoring thread will look at it again.

    Also, if the final check failed in the membership coordinator there's no
    point in doing another check so we move directly to removing the
    suspect.

    GEODE-6244 Healthy member kicked out by Sick member

    GMSMembershipManager.verifyMember() should not initiate direct removal
    of the target member if an availability check fails.  Instead it should
    initiate suspect processing.

    This adds new unit tests for GMSHealthMonitor.checkIfAvailable() and
    changes the availability check to initiate suspect processing if the
    check fails.

+      newView.makeImmutable();
