GEODE-3961: Refactor ShowMetricsCommand to handle --categories uniformly

* GEODE-3961: Refactor ShowMetricsCommand to behave uniformly when --categories is provided.

* The ShowMetricsCommand has been almost entirely refactored, but with minimal change to existing behavior.
* The category "cache-server" has been renamed to "cacheserver"
* The "query" category now only lists once instead of twice.
* Category checking is now performed by the client, not the server.
* Alphabetized excludedClasses.txt
