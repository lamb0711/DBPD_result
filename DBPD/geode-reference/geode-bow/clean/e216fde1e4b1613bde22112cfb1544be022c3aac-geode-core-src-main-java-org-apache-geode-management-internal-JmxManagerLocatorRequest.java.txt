GEODE-2804 Update InetSocketAddress, when there is IOException.

Geode keeps InetSocketAddress for locators. So, if locators ip
changes in cloud/VM enviroment then Geode process unable to
connect to locator. Thus we have fixed this problem in two way.

a. If Geode client sees IOException while connecting to locator then
we change cached InetAddress to use locator hostname. In this way,
client does DNS query again for locator host.
b. For other Geode process, now we connect to locator using hostname.

Added couple of junit tests for it.

+import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
+    InetSocketAddress inetSockAddr = new InetSocketAddress(networkAddress, locatorPort);
-      Object responseFromServer =
-          client.requestToServer(networkAddress, locatorPort, SINGLETON, msTimeout);
+      Object responseFromServer = client.requestToServer(inetSockAddr, SINGLETON, msTimeout, true);
