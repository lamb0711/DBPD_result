* change the auto complete to use log4j levels.
* be able to handle both log4j levels and logwriter levels in the commands
* add validation of log level whenever possible for these commands
* Move the conversion between the two to a LogLevel class and add unit tests

+import org.apache.geode.internal.logging.log4j.LogLevel;
-    final int level = LogWriterImpl.levelNameToCode(st.nextToken());
+    final int level = LogLevel.getLogWriterLevel(st.nextToken());
