GEODE-77 removed shutdown status check.

This check was recently added but it is keeping the manager from
properly shutting down because the status is set by
DirectChannel before the manager is told to shut down.

-    if (!shutdownInProgress) {
-      setShutdown();
-      services.stop();
-    }
+    setShutdown();
+    services.stop();
