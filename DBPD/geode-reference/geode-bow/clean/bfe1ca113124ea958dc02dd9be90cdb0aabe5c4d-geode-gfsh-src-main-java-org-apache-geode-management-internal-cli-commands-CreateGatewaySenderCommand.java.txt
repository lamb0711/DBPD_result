GEODE-8240: Member Identifier Future Versions

Inability of member identifiers to hold future versions caused 
problems in rolling upgrades. Now member identifiers hang on 
to a VersionOrdinal which is a base type for Version "enum".
-        member -> ((InternalDistributedMember) member).getVersionObject().equals(Version.CURRENT));
+        member -> ((InternalDistributedMember) member).getVersionOrdinalObject()
+            .equals(Version.CURRENT));
