  QueryObserver interface.
+import org.apache.geode.cache.query.Aggregator;

+   * functions and group by.
+   *
+   * @param selectResults The result set before applying the aggregations.
+   *
+   * @see Aggregator
+   * @see CompiledGroupBySelect
+   */
+  default void beforeAggregationsAndGroupBy(
+      @SuppressWarnings("unused") SelectResults selectResults) {}
