GEODE-6013: Made changes to use the expected initial image requester's rvv information (#2819)

* GEODE-6013: Made changes to use the expected initial image requester's rvv information instead of the image provider's local rvv while determining full or delta GII.

There was logical error where it was using provider's local exception(rvv) instead of using requester's local exception(rvv). This could result in performing Delta GII instead of Full GII.
