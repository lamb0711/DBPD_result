GEODE-1984: Addressed review comments,
Removed copy pasted repeating code and moved it into a separate method.

-   * Destroys the GatewaySender. Before destroying the sender, caller needs to to ensure that the
-   * sender is stopped so that all the resources (threads, connection pool etc.) will be released
-   * properly. Stopping the sender is not handled in the destroy. Destroy is carried out in
-   * following steps: 1. Take the lifeCycleLock. 2. If the sender is attached to any application
-   * region, throw an exception. 3. Close the GatewaySenderAdvisor. 4. Remove the sender from the
-   * cache. 5. Destroy the region underlying the GatewaySender.
+   * Destroys the GatewaySender.
-   * In case of ParallelGatewaySender, the destroy operation does distributed destroy of the QPR. In
-   * case of SerialGatewaySender, the queue region is destroyed locally.
+   * In case of ParallelGatewaySender, the destroy operation does distributed destroy of the Queue
+   * Region. In case of SerialGatewaySender, the Queue Region is destroyed locally.
