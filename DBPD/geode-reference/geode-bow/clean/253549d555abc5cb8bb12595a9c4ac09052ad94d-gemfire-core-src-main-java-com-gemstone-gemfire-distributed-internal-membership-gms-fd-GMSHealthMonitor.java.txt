corrections for GMSHealthMonitor from an impromptu code review

Engineers working on the GEODE-77 effort reviewed some of the final-check
code in GMSHealthMonitor and came up with these corrections.

This commit also includes some test clean-up that I hope will help with
GEODE-589.

-            // double check the activity map
-            if (checkRecentActivity(member)) {
-              return true;
-            }
-    // first check for a recent timestamp
-    if (checkRecentActivity(suspectMember)) {
-      return true;
-    }
-          return checkRecentActivity(suspectMember);
+          return false;
-        return checkRecentActivity(suspectMember);
+        return false;
-                contactedBy(mbr);
