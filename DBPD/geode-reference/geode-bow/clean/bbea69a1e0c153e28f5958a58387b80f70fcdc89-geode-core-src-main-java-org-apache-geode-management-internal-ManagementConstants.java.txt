GEODE-3540: unable to gfsh destroy gateway-sender (#1414)

   GW sender bean is not unregistered during destroy command which
   is why it appears when you list gateways after destroy. This fix is to 
   unregistered the MX bean from SystemManagementService
+  String GATEWAY_SENDER_REMOVED_PREFIX = "GatewaySender Removed in the VM ";
