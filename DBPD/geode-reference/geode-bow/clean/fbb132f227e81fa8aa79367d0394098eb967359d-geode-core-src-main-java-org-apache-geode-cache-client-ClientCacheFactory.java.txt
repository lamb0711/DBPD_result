GEODE-5771: Deprecate PDX Persistence on Client

Currently, even when set, the PDX metadata is not persisted on the
client side (to avoid dealing with problems that might arise if the
client's PDX data is inconsistent with the server).

- Methods `setPdxPersistent` and `setPdxDiskStore` from
  `ClientCacheFactory` have been deprecated.
- Attributes `persistent` and `disk-store-name` from the element `pdx`
  have been deprecated (new complex type `client-pdx-type` has been
  added to avoid messing with the pdx definition used for non-clients).
- A `warning` message will now be logged when creating the cache if we
  detect that PDX persistence has been configured for a client cache.
- Added test methods to `ClientCacheFactoryJUnitTest`, also replaced
  the usage of `junit.Assert` by `assertj`, and manual file
  manipulation/cleanup by `TemporaryFolder` rule.
