GEODE-1209: Changes to ignoreEvictionAndExpiration AEQ attribute based on the new proposal
(changing ignoreEvictionAndExpiration to forwardExpirationDestroy).

GEODE-1209 was proposed to add new attribute ignoreEvictionAndExpiration to AsyncEventQueue.
As mentioned in the ticket due to product issue a new proposal was made to change the
functionality, to only forward expiration-destroy operation.

The changes made here replaces ignoreEvictionAndExpiration attribute to forwardExiprationDestroy.

-    
-    // forward eviction and expiration events.
-    String ignoreEvictionExpiration = atts.getValue(IGNORE_EVICTION_AND_EXPIRATION);
-    if (ignoreEvictionExpiration != null) {
-      asyncEventQueueCreation.setIgnoreEvictionAndExpiration(Boolean.parseBoolean(ignoreEvictionExpiration));
+
+    // forward expiration destroy events.
+    String forward = atts.getValue(FORWARD_EXPIRATION_DESTROY);
+    if (forward != null) {
+      asyncEventQueueCreation.setForwardExpirationDestroy(Boolean.parseBoolean(forward));
-    
+
-  
+
-    factory.setIgnoreEvictionAndExpiration(asyncEventChannelCreation.isIgnoreEvictionAndExpiration());
+    factory.setForwardExpirationDestroy(asyncEventChannelCreation.isForwardExpirationDestroy());
