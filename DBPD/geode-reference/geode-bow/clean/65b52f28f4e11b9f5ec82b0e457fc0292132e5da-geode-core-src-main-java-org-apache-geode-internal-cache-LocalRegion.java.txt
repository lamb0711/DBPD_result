GEODE-4957: fix race in concurrent create on region (#1750)

Refactored basicPut so that a RegionEntry with REMOVE_PHASE1
is added to the map, it will already be synchronized.
This prevents a second concurrent threads from "stealing" it and
creating a region entry with a key that is the same but has a different
identity.

-  void cleanUpOnIncompleteOp(EntryEventImpl event, RegionEntry regionEntry) {
-    // Ok to remove entry as index has not been modified yet by the operation
-    this.entries.removeEntry(event.getKey(), regionEntry, false);
-  }
