new unit tests and code clean-up

New unit tests to increase code coverage.  I also tinkered with
trying to get EclEmma output from DUnit ChildVMs but it seems to
be run in a shutdownHook in parallel with the DUnitLauncher
shutdownHook.

-        //TODO - stop it gracefully? Why bother
+  public synchronized boolean hasLiveVMs() {
+    for(ProcessHolder process : processes.values()) {
+      if(process != null && process.isAlive()) {
+        return true;
+      }
+    }
+    return false;
+  }
+  
+    
+    public boolean isAlive() {
+      return !killed && process.isAlive();
+    }
