GEODE-6230 Add test start/stop logging to tests using distributed test Rules

Added logging to AbstractDistributedRule and moved history logging out
of JUnit4DistributedTestCase and into another class so it can be used by
Rules w/o referring to a deprecated class.

-    System.out.println("linking IO streams for " + vmName);
