GEODE-77 added a test for DistributionMessage.isPreciousThread()

This method wasn't correctly determining that a JGroups thread should
not be used for dispatching a cache operation message.  I corrected the
check and added a unit test.

-    return thrname.startsWith("GEODE UDP");
+    return thrname.startsWith("Geode UDP");
