GEODE-1393 locator returns incorrect server information when starting up

When a locator auto-reconnects its ServerLocator needs to initialize its
ControllerAdvisor so that it has server information to give to clients.
The ServerLocator was creating a new ControllerAdvisor but didn't ask it
to perform a handshake to fill in its profiles.

ReconnectDUnitTest had an existing testReconnectWithQuorum test that
wasn't doing what it was supposed to.  I've removed the TODO from that
test and modified it to force-disconnect the tests Locator.  The
locator must restart its TcpServer component before it can start
a DistributedSystem, so this exercises the path in
InternalLocator.attemptReconnect() that boots the TcpServer prior to
connecting the DistributedSystem.  After the DistributedSystem
finishes reconnecting the ServerLocator's distribution advisor
should have been initialized by performing the handshake.
