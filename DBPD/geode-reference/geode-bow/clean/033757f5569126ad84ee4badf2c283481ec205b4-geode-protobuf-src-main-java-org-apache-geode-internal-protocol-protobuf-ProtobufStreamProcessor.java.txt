GEODE-3751: a single place for client protocol loading, logic.

* Load a single service, `ClientProtocolService`.
  - (well, authenticators are still separate).
* Move several interfaces to `geode-protobuf` from core.
* Client protocol state and statistics are now stored on the new
  `ClientProtocolPipeline` interface. This will allow us to keep
  connection logic for core separated from protocol logic.
* implement pipelines for Cache and Locator.
* some other small fixes and changes.
