GEODE-5081 ClientCacheFactory is missing the setPoolSubscriptionTimeoutMultiplier()

Added the missing method & a test for it

This closes #1804

+   * The client will time out it's subscription connection after a number of seconds equal to this
+   * multiplier times the server's subscription-timeout.
+   * <p>
+   * Set this to 2 or more to make sure the client will receive pings from the server before the
+   * timeout.
+   * <p>
