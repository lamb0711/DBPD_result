GEODE-7220 NPE in the logs on reconnect (#4074)

* GEODE-7220 NPE in the logs on reconnect

Use reflection to poke a new Receiver into JGroups to avoid
synchronization problems in JGroups code.

No new tests were needed.

* rewrote comment - we're trying to avoid a warning message and an NPE

+      // and the channel already has one. Rather than set the receiver to null &
+      // then establish a new one we use reflection to set the channel receiver. See GEODE-7220
