GEODE-77: improvements in handling loss of coordinator

1) Locator join-timeout has been bumped from 17 sec to 24.  This allows it to join in spite of the loss of the current coordinator and several backup coordinators.

2) Join responses are now sent after "prepare for view" messages so that other members have some knowledge of the new members before they are allowed into the system.  If the coordinator dies before completing preparation the new coordinator will find this prepared view and now adds its new members to its own membership view.

3) We no longer clear the collection of already-tried potential-coordinators when a new view is processed during startup.  Since join-requests have already been sent to these addresses there is no point in trying them again.

4) The coordinator now periodically sends out the current view to members and to crashed members of the last view using unreliable messaging.  This helps get rid of rogue processes & is similar to what we did with the view-sync JGroups protocol in GemFire.  I new method for unreliable message transmission to Messenger for this purpose.  This keeps JGroups UNICAST3 protocol from recreating a retransmission table entry for the old, crashed, members who would reject the old sequence numbers generated by the new table entry and never dispatch the messages.

5) Removal requests are now processed in the ViewCreator after all other requests have been processed.  This prevents a member from being kicked out when we've already received a shutdown message from that member.

6) Several new unit tests

-        logger.debug("GMSHealthMonitor received health check UUID {}:{}.", uuidMSBs, uuidLSBs);
+        boolean debug = logger.isDebugEnabled();
+        if (debug) {
+          logger.debug("GMSHealthMonitor received health check UUID {},{}",
+              Long.toHexString(uuidMSBs),
+              Long.toHexString(uuidLSBs));
+        }
-        logger.debug("GMSHealthMonitor my UUID is {}:{}", myUUID.getMostSignificantBits(), myUUID.getLeastSignificantBits());
-        if (uuidLSBs == myUUID.getLeastSignificantBits()
+        if (debug) {
+          if (playingDead) {
+            logger.debug("simulating sick member in health check");
+          } else if (uuidLSBs == myUUID.getLeastSignificantBits()
+            && uuidMSBs == myUUID.getMostSignificantBits()) {
+            logger.debug("UUID matches my own - sending OK reply");
+          } else {
+            logger.debug("GMSHealthMonitor my UUID is                 {},{}",
+              Long.toHexString(myUUID.getMostSignificantBits()),
+              Long.toHexString(myUUID.getLeastSignificantBits()));
+          }
+        }
+        if (!playingDead
+            && uuidLSBs == myUUID.getLeastSignificantBits()
-          logger.debug("GMSHealthMonitor server socket replied OK.");
+          if (debug) {
+            logger.debug("GMSHealthMonitor server socket replied OK.");
+          }
-          logger.debug("GMSHealthMonitor server socket replied ERROR.");
+          if (debug) {
+            logger.debug("GMSHealthMonitor server socket replied ERROR.");
+          }
