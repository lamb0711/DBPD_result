GEODE-634 CI failure: DistributedMemberDUnitTest.testRolesInAllVMs

Fixed the suspect string and added unit tests.  I also added a new constructor
in NetView and modified tests that were using the full constructor with
empty crashed/left member sets to use it.  That simplified their code a bit.

+  public NetView(InternalDistributedMember creator, int viewId, List<InternalDistributedMember> members) {
+    this.viewId = 0;
+    this.members = new ArrayList<InternalDistributedMember>(members);
+    hashedMembers = new HashSet<>(members);
+    shutdownMembers = new HashSet<>();
+    crashedMembers = Collections.emptySet();
+    this.creator = creator;
+    Arrays.fill(failureDetectionPorts, -1);
+  }
