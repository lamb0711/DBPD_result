Fix for GEODE-109

1) To fix this floating meta data problem for the redis list implementation, this meta data has been moved into the list region itself
2) Sorted set query failures are fixed by using fully qualified names and also depends on GEODE-146
3) Concurrent region creation/destruction logic completely changed to use dedicated locks for synchronization, fixed distributed deadlock
4) Added integration tests
5) Add javadocs where necessary

This closes #13

- * <p>
- * The contents include the following
- * <p>
- * <li>The channel from which the command was read and to where
- * the response will be written.</li>
- * <li>The list of elements in the command. Every command is sent as an array of BulkStrings.
- * For example if the command "SADD key member1 member2 member3" was sent, the list would contain
- * {"SADD", "key", "member1", "member2", "member3"}.
- * <li>The {@link RedisCommandType}</li>
- * <li>The response to be written back to the client</li>
