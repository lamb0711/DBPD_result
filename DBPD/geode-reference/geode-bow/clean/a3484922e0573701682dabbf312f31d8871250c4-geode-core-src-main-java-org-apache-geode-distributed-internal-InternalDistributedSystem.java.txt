GEODE-3557: remove calls to GemFireCacheImpl getInstance

The DM now remembers the InternalCache that created it.
Changed places that had a dm to use its getCache method
instead of GemFireCacheImpl getInstance.

+
+  public void setCache(InternalCache instance) {
+    this.dm.setCache(instance);
+  }
