+    deleteStatus(workingDirectory);
-  void deleteStatus(final File workingDirectory, final String statusFileName) throws IOException {
+  void deleteStatus(final File workingDirectory) throws IOException {
-    return readStatus(workingDirectory, statusFileName);
+    return readStatus(workingDirectory);
-  Status readStatus(final File workingDirectory, final String statusFileName) throws IOException {
+  Status readStatus(final File workingDirectory) throws IOException {
