GEODE-5523: Remove DefaultHashMap

The internal class `DefaultHashMap` was designed as an internal
workaround to return a default value whenever the value returned by
`Map.get(K)` was `null`. Starting with Java 8 the `Map` interface
added the method `getOrDefault`, which does something similar in a more
efficient way but it returns the default only if the key doesn't exist.
After inspecting the code, we don't insert `null` values into the
`statsMap`, so it is safe to delete the old `DefaultHashMap` class and
replace its usaged by `Map.getOrDefault`.

-      Number processCpuTime = statsMap.get(StatsKey.VM_PROCESS_CPU_TIME);
+      Number processCpuTime = statsMap.getOrDefault(StatsKey.VM_PROCESS_CPU_TIME, 0);
