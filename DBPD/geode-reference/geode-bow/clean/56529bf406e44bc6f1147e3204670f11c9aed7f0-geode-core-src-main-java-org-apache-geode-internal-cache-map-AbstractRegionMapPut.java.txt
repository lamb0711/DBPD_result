GEODE-92: Fix deadlock issue from previous commit (#3061)

The commit f4b0643 introduced deadlock between concurrent updates with custom expiry which invoked getValue() from the region entry.

* The issue was fixed by making sure lruUpdateCallback is deferred/called at the higher/caller level (before synchronizing region entry).

+   *
+   * @param disabledEviction true if caller previously disabled eviction
-  protected abstract void doAfterCompletionActions();
+  protected abstract void doAfterCompletionActions(boolean disabledEviction);
+    final boolean disabledEviction = getRegionMap().disableLruUpdateCallback();
-      doAfterCompletionActions();
+      doAfterCompletionActions(disabledEviction);
