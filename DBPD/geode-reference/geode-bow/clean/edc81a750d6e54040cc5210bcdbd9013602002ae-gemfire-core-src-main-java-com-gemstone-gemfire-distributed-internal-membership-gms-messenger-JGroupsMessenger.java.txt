GEODE-77 adding additional test coverage

Test coverage is now > 71% for all membership services.
This also fixes a problem in GMSJoinLeave.join where a member that
was shut down & restarted with a start-locator setting formed a
split-brain.  Now we send a collection of previously attempted
coordinators with FindCoordinator requests, and a member receiving
a join request will check to see if the new member ought to assume
the role of coordinator.  See LocatorDUnitTest.testCollocatedLocatorWithSecurity.

-    boolean isLocator = (services.getConfig().getTransport().getVmKind() == DistributionManager.LOCATOR_DM_TYPE); 
+    boolean isLocator = (services.getConfig().getTransport().getVmKind() == DistributionManager.LOCATOR_DM_TYPE)
+        || !services.getConfig().getDistributionConfig().getStartLocator().isEmpty();
-      if (logger.isTraceEnabled())
-        logger.trace("This message is being multicast");
+      logger.trace("This message is being multicast");
