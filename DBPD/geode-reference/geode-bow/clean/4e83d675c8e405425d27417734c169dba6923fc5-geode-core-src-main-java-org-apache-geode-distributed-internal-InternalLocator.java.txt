GEODE-5819: Reduce 16h40m wait on shutdown to 120 seconds. (#2736)

* While this is unlikely to correct the Java11 SSL handshake failures, it should make tests currently hanging properly fail out so that a full failure-set can be analyzed.
-        this.server.join(TcpServer.SHUTDOWN_WAIT_TIME * 1000 + 10000);
+        // TcpServer up to SHUTDOWN_WAIT_TIME for its executor pool to shut down.
+        // We wait 2 * SHUTDOWN_WAIT_TIME here to account for that shutdown, and then our own.
+        this.server.join(TcpServer.SHUTDOWN_WAIT_TIME * 2);
