[GEODE-157] Check for colocation not failing if non colocated comparison is first comparison made
Fixed issue where if first region being checked happens to not be colocated, no longer ignores and
throws the correct exception

-      QueryExecutor root = null;
+      QueryExecutor other = null;
-
+          other = allPRs;
-        if (!colocated && root != null) {
+        if (!colocated) { 
-                  root.getName() }));
+                  other.getName() }));
-        root = eachPR;
