Adding a couple of simple junit tests for FileSystem

Testing some basic file write and read operations, as well as file
renames and deletes.

I also added some more javadocs to the filesystem classes and moved them
into a separate package.

+import com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.lucene.internal.filesystem.ChunkKey;
+import com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.lucene.internal.filesystem.File;
+import com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.lucene.internal.filesystem.FileSystem;
