GEODE-1723 Merge from 82 for performance improvement.

Other improvement:We take lock on key while doing op on BucketRegion.
In that case we notify to other thread only when there is a thread
waiting for it. Modified one condition to log message to reduce garbage.

+          foundLock.waiting();
-            lockValue.notifyAll();
+            if (lockValue.isSomeoneWaiting()) {
+              lockValue.notifyAll();
+            }
