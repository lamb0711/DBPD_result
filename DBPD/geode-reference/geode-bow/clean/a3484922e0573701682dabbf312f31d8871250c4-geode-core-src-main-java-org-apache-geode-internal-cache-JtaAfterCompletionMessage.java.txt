GEODE-3557: remove calls to GemFireCacheImpl getInstance

The DM now remembers the InternalCache that created it.
Changed places that had a dm to use its getCache method
instead of GemFireCacheImpl getInstance.

-    TXManagerImpl txMgr = GemFireCacheImpl.getInstance().getTXMgr();
+    TXManagerImpl txMgr = dm.getCache().getTXMgr();
