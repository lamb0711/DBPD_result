GEODE-1304: remove TODO OFFHEAP comments

Tickets have been filed with the information from the removed comments.

This checkin does change LocalRegion validatedCreate/Put/Destroy
to no longer do an offheap release; instead the calling method does.

-      v =re.getValue(this);  // TODO OFFHEAP: todo v ends up in a RawValue. For now this can be a copy of the offheap onto the heap. But it might be easy to track lifetime of RawValue
+      v =re.getValue(this);
-          // TODO OFFHEAP: optimze
