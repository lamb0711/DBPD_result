GEODE-2429: Do not execute JTA afterCompletion if transaction is rolled back in beforeCompletion

JTA afterCompletion should not be executed if
the transaction is already rolled back.
Add a dunit test case showing transaction is
cleaned up on server if beforeCompletion failed
on client cache.

+  private boolean txRolledback = false;
+
+      txRolledback = true;
+      if (txRolledback) {
+        return;
+      }
