GEODE-3175 backward-compatibility tests fail with bad classpath

Checking in changes on a feature branch that remove current-version
product classes from the classpaths of JVMs running old versions
of Geode.

+  // prior to v1.2.0 GEODE_110 was named GFE_91. This was used for both the rel/v1.1.0
+  // and rel/v1.1.1 releases
+  // This ordinal was never used
-  public static final short NOT_SUPPORTED_ORDINAL = 59;
-
-    // Un-version client(client's prior to release 5.7) doesn't send version
-    // byte in the handshake. So the next byte in the handshake has value 59 and
-    // is interpreted as version byte. We are not supporting version 59 to
-    // distinguish version client from unversion. Please use version ordinal 60
-    // after 58 if required.

-      throw new UnsupportedVersionException("Un-versioned clients are not supported. ");
