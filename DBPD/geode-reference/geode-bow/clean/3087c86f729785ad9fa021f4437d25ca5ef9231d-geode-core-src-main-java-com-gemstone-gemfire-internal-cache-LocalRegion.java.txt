GEODE-982: refactor off-heap

- removed unused MemoryChunk implementations
- collapsed OffHeapCacheDeserializable into StoredObject
- Added Slab, SlabFactory, SlabImpl, and AddressableMemoryManager.
- collapsed MemoryChunkWithRefCount into StoredObject
- methods that access and modify the data now have Data in their name
- collapsed AddressableStoredObject into StoredObject
- changed product code to use the StoredObject interface
  instead of internal class implementations of it
- renamed DataAsAddress to TinyStoredObject
- renamed ObjectChunk to OffHeapStoredObject
- renamed ObjectChunkWithHeapForm to OffHeapStoredObjectWithHeapForm
- renamed allocateChunk to allocateOffHeapStoredObject
- renamed FakeChunk to SearchMarker
- renamed ObjectChunkSlice to OffHeapStoredObjectSlice
- renamed SyncChunkStack to OffHeapStoredObjectAddressStack
- renamed ChunkValueWrapper to OffHeapValueWrapper

-import com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.offheap.ObjectChunk;
+    // TODO OFFHEAP: the last parameter "retainResult" should be true for getRetained. Need to look into what it is being set to false.
-          //For sqlf since the deserialized value is nothing but chunk
-          // before returning the found value increase its use count
-          if(GemFireCacheImpl.sqlfSystem() && result instanceof ObjectChunk) {
-            if(!((ObjectChunk)result).retain()) {
-              return null;
-            }
-          }
-          // what was a miss is now a hit
+         // what was a miss is now a hit
