GEODE-1238: fix EntryEventImpl already released

DistributedPut/RemoveAllOperation now have getEventForPosition
as @Unretained. The callers of this method no longer release
since the operation will release these events already at the end
of its life.

+import com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.offheap.annotations.Unretained;
-          @Released final EntryEventImpl ev = dpao.getEventForPosition(idx);
-          try {
+          @Unretained final EntryEventImpl ev = dpao.getEventForPosition(idx);
-          } finally {
-            ev.release();
-          }
-         @Released final EntryEventImpl ev = op.getEventForPosition(idx);
-         try {
+         @Unretained final EntryEventImpl ev = op.getEventForPosition(idx);
-         } finally {
-           ev.release();
-         }
