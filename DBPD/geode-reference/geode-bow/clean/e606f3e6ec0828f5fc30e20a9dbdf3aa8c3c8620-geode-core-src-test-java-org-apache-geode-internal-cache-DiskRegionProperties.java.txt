GEODE-1672: Disabled recovering values for LRU region during startup.

When recovering persistent files, system stores the values in temp
maps (for regions) using a background thread, as these maps are not
actual regions, the temp-regions are  not considered/included for
LRU eviction, which causes the system to run OOM.

The problem is fixed by skipping recovering  values for LRU regions.

A new system property ""disk.recoverLruValues" is added to support
reading values for lru regions.
