fixing a problem with the new constructor in NetView

The new constructor used by unit tests was not setting the viewId correctly,
causing a few tests to fail.

-    this.viewId = 0;
+    this.viewId = viewId;
-    hashedMembers = new HashSet<>(members);
+    hashedMembers = new HashSet<>(this.members);
