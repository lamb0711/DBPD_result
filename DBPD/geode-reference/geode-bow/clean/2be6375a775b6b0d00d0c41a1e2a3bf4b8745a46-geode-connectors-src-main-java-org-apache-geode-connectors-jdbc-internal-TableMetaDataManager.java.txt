GEODE-6404: work around possible sync issue with computeIfAbsent (#3196)

* GEODE-6404: work around possible synchronization issue with computeIfAbsent

  *  Tries to do the get() outside of a lock before computing
  *  Added jmh test
  *  Local benchmarking showed that although jdk 11 fixes the contention issue that
       performing the get was faster than the retrieve mechanism of computeIfAbsent

+import org.apache.geode.internal.util.JavaWorkarounds;
-    return tableToMetaDataMap.computeIfAbsent(computeTableName(regionMapping),
+    return JavaWorkarounds.computeIfAbsent(tableToMetaDataMap, computeTableName(regionMapping),
