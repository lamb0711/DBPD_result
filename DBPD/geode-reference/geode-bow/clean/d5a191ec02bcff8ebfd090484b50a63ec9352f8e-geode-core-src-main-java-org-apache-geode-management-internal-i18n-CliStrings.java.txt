GEODE-7536 - Break Gfsh out into separate module (#4422)


- ManagementUtils is split from CliUtil with non-CLI methods.
- Introduce new CommandProcessor interface which is a CacheService. This
  is implemented by OnlineCommandProcessor and is used in
  MemberMBeanBridge.
- Remove try/catch from ClusterConfigurationStatusRetriever since any
  exception will be handled at a higher level.
