GEODE-4765: Add retries when retrieving cluster config (#1539)

- This helps when a locator is reconnecting to the distributed system and isn't
  fully ready yet.
- During reconnect, pass a fresh cache to the ClusterConfigurationService -
  this fixes the 'DLock destroyed' issue.
- Also fixes GEODE-4730

-      startSharedConfigurationService();
+      if (isSharedConfigurationEnabled()) {
+        this.sharedConfig = new ClusterConfigurationService(newCache);
+        startSharedConfigurationService();
+      }
