GEODE-3622: Implement new algorithm for eviction (#1017)

* GEODE-3622: Implement new algorithm for eviction

  * Old algorithm is still used by default. Use "-Dgeode.EvictionScanAsync=true"
    to enable the new algorithm. Note that the new algorithm is still experimental
    and is subject to change. The new algorithm uses asynchronous sorting of the
    LRU list to prevent a long synchronous sort when the first item is evicted.
  * Moved region entries into their own package
  * Organized eviction code into new eviction package
  * General refactoring of eviction classes
