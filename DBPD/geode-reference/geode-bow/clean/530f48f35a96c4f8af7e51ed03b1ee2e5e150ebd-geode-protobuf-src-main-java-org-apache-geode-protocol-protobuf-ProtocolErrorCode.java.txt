GEODE-3406: Locator accepts Protobuf requests

Also addresses GEODE-3400, GEODE-3399
This allows the locator to respond to Protobuf requests. Currently it
will only be able to respond to getAvailableServers.

To enable this we are introducing a new value of "0" that will be sent
in place of the Gossip version. After it we expect the same magic byte
("110") as in AcceptorImpl.

This also is gated by the `geode.feature-protobuf-protocol` system
property.

The getAvailableServers request handler now uses the locator directly,
since we are on the locator.
