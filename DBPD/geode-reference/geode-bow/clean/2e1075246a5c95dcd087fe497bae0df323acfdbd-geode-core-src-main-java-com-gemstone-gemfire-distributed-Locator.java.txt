- * process. A stand-alone locator process is managed using 
- * {@linkplain com.gemstone.gemfire.admin.DistributionLocator administration
- * API} or the <code>gemfire</code> command line utility:
- * 
- * <PRE>
- * $ gemfire start-locator
- * </PRE>
+ * process. A stand-alone locator process is managed using gfsh command line utility. 
- * recommended because if the application VM exits, the primary membership list
- * for the distributed system would be lost and it would not be possible for new
- * applications to connect to the distributed system.
+ * recommended because if the application VM exits it would not be possible for new
+ * applications to connect to the distributed system until it is restarted.
+ * Locators persist membership information in a locatorXXXview.dat file.  This
+ * file is used to recover information about the cluster when a locator starts
+ * if there are no other currently running locators.  It allows the restarted
+ * locator to rejoin the cluster.
