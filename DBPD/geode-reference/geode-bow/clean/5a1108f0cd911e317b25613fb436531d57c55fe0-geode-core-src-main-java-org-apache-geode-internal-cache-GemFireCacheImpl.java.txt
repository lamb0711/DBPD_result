GEODE-3521: Allow region set operations to bootstrap a transaction. (#891)

* GEODE-3521: Allow region set operations to bootstrap a transaction.

  * Now Geode will bootstrap a transaction on a region set op even though
    it is a first operation in the transaction.
 * Add a SystemPropertyHelper class to held system properties to be set.
  * User needs to set a system property to disable this new behavior.
  * Do not allow an accessor to bootstrap a transaction.
  * Add a PausedTXStateProxyImpl state to allow product to know if a transaction is paused.
   *Product now detects if only same thread can unpause a paused transaction.
  * Do not bootstrap a new transaction again when transaction is paused.
  * Add a test case for testing pause and unpause.
  * A thread can not pause a transaction and start a new transaction - use suspend and resume instead.
 * Handle a situation that RegionEntry can be set in the KeyInfo when iterate through keys.

-          tx = this.transactionManager.internalSuspend();
+          tx = this.transactionManager.pauseTransaction();
-          this.transactionManager.internalResume(tx);
+          this.transactionManager.unpauseTransaction(tx);
