GEODE-5686: Remove LocalizedStrings

This removes the LocalizedStrings class and most uses of LogWriterI18n.
The I18n interfaces are still in place and still work since they're only
deprecated but there are no longer any uses of the StringID logging methods.

Going forward everyone should use the Log4j logging facility.  If you
must use the deprecated LogWriter use that version and not
LogWriterI18n.

-import static org.apache.geode.internal.i18n.LocalizedStrings.InternalDistributedSystem_COULD_NOT_OPEN_LOG_FILE_0;
-import org.apache.geode.i18n.LogWriterI18n;
-import org.apache.geode.internal.i18n.LocalizedStrings;
- * Implementation of {@link LogWriterI18n} that will write to a local stream
+ * Implementation of {@link org.apache.geode.LogWriter} that will write to a local stream
-        printWriter.println(LocalizedStrings.PureLogWriter_IGNORING_EXCEPTION.toLocalizedString());
+        printWriter.println("Ignoring exception: ");
-      String s = InternalDistributedSystem_COULD_NOT_OPEN_LOG_FILE_0.toLocalizedString(logFile);
+      String s = String.format("Could not open log file \"%s\".", logFile);
