GEODE-2198: close and re-create the cache on a server when importing new cluster configuration

* When importing cluster config first check if there is any non-empty region
* close and re-create cache if no data exists when importing new cluster configuration
* put the acquire/release lock inside the ClusterConfigurationService instead of command execution strategy.

+    // make sure this cache is the once currently open. A server cache can be recreated due to
+    // importing a new set of cluster configuration.
+    cache = GemFireCacheImpl.getInstance();
