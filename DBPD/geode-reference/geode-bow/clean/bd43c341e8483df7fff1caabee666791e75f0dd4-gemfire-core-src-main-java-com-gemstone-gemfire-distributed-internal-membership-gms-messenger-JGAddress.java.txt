new unit tests and code clean-up

New unit tests to increase code coverage.  I also tinkered with
trying to get EclEmma output from DUnit ChildVMs but it seems to
be run in a shutdownHook in parallel with the DUnitLauncher
shutdownHook.

-  private void setAddressToLocalHost() {
-      try {
-          ip_addr=InetAddress.getLocalHost();  // get first NIC found (on multi-homed systems)
-      }
-      catch(Exception e) {
-          ip_addr=null;
-      }
-      if(ip_addr == null) {
-          try {
-              ip_addr=InetAddress.getByName(null);
-          }
-          catch(UnknownHostException e) {
-          }
-      }
-  }
