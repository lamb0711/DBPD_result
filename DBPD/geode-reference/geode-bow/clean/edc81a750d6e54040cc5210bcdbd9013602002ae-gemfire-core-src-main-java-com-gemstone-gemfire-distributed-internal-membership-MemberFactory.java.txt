GEODE-77 adding additional test coverage

Test coverage is now > 71% for all membership services.
This also fixes a problem in GMSJoinLeave.join where a member that
was shut down & restarted with a start-locator setting formed a
split-brain.  Now we send a collection of previously attempted
coordinators with FindCoordinator requests, and a member receiving
a join request will check to see if the new member ought to assume
the role of coordinator.  See LocatorDUnitTest.testCollocatedLocatorWithSecurity.

+import com.gemstone.gemfire.distributed.internal.LocatorStats;
-          boolean networkPartitionDetectionEnabled) {
+          boolean networkPartitionDetectionEnabled, LocatorStats stats) {
-        usePreferredCoordinators, networkPartitionDetectionEnabled);
+        usePreferredCoordinators, networkPartitionDetectionEnabled, stats);
