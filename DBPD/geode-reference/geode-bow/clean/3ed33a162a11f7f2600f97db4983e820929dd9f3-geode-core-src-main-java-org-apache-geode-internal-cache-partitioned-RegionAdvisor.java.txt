GEODE-5307 Hang with servers all in waitForPrimaryMember and one server in NO_PRIMARY_HOSTING state

Ignore the primaryElector if it is no longer known to the RegionAdvisor.
This means that the elector has somehow gone away - either it crashed,
shut down or destroyed its region.

+  /**
+   * return true if the given member has this advisor's partitioned region
+   */
+  public boolean hasPartitionedRegion(InternalDistributedMember profileId) {
+    if (getDistributionManager().getId().equals(profileId)) {
+      return true;
+    }
+    return (getProfile(profileId) != null);
+  }
