GEODE-7663: Fix delta update inconsistency in client cache. (#4618)

* GEODE-7663: Fix delta update inconsistency in client cache.

 * When performing delta update on client, there is a possibility that
   some delta update is not yet applied on client cache.
 * If apply delta update, some queued delta update would be lost -- as
   entry versioning will discard these delta updates when received later.
 * Now it will check if there is a versioning mismatch, if it happened,
   the full value from server will be applied instead of just the delta.
