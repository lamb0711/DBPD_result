GEODE-77 adding additional test coverage

Test coverage is now > 71% for all membership services.
This also fixes a problem in GMSJoinLeave.join where a member that
was shut down & restarted with a start-locator setting formed a
split-brain.  Now we send a collection of previously attempted
coordinators with FindCoordinator requests, and a member receiving
a join request will check to see if the new member ought to assume
the role of coordinator.  See LocatorDUnitTest.testCollocatedLocatorWithSecurity.

+  private boolean becomeCoordinator;
+  public JoinResponseMessage(InternalDistributedMember memberID, NetView view, boolean becomeCoordinator) {
+    this.currentView = view;
+    this.memberID = memberID;
+    setRecipient(memberID);
+    this.becomeCoordinator = becomeCoordinator;
+  }
+  
+  
+  public boolean getBecomeCoordinator() {
+    return becomeCoordinator;
+  }
-        + (rejectionMessage==null? "" : rejectionMessage)

+        + (becomeCoordinator? "; becomeCoordinator" : "")

+    becomeCoordinator = in.readBoolean();
