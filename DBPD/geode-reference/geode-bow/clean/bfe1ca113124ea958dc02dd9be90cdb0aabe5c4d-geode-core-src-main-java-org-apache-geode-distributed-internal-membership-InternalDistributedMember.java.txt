GEODE-8240: Member Identifier Future Versions

Inability of member identifiers to hold future versions caused 
problems in rolling upgrades. Now member identifiers hang on 
to a VersionOrdinal which is a base type for Version "enum".
+import org.apache.geode.internal.serialization.VersionOrdinal;
+  public VersionOrdinal getVersionOrdinalObject() {
+    return memberIdentifier.getVersionOrdinalObject();
+  }
+
+  /**
+   * If this member runs a version known in this JVM then return that Version.
+   * If this member does not run a known version then return Version.CURRENT.
+   *
+   * In various serialization scenarios we want the well-known version for this
+   * member, or, if it doesn't have a well-known version, we want the current
+   * (in this JVM) software version. Rather than have that logic spread around in
+   * the serialization code, it is centralized here.
+   */
-    return memberIdentifier.getVersionObject();
+    return Version.fromOrdinalNoThrow(getVersionOrdinalObject().ordinal(), false);
