GEODE-871: Frequient use of executeOnAllServers causes build-up of TIME_WAIT sockets

Modified the fix to not abort the connection if a response wasn't read.
I also propagated this pattern to GMSHealthMonitor so that the "final
check" sockets are quickly released.

-      if (out != null) {
-        out.close();
-      }
+        if (replyExpected) {
+          // Since we've read a response we know that the Locator is finished
+          // with the socket and is closing it.  Aborting the connection by
+          // setting SO_LINGER to zero will clean up the TIME_WAIT socket on
+          // the locator's machine.
+          sock.setSoLinger(true, 0);
+        }
+      if (out != null) {
+        out.close();
+      }
-    VersionResponse verRes = null;
+        sock.setSoLinger(true, 0); // initiate an abort on close to shut down the server's socket
