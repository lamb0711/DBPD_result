GEODE-5074 REST dev client should not access or modify internal regions

The Developer REST API was accessing a raw cache for all operations.
I've switched it to use a filtered InternalCacheForClientAccess cache
instead.  I added a new method to the filtered cach to allow the REST
code to get its Query Store region.

+  /**
+   * Server-side code using an InternalCacheForClientAccess may need to
+   * get an Internal Region not normally accesible and may use this method to
+   * do so. The REST API, for instance, needs to get at a Query store
+   * region that is not otherwise accessible through the getRegion methods.
+   */
+  public <K, V> Region<K, V> getInternalRegion(String path) {
+    Region<K, V> result = delegate.getRegion(path);
+    return result;
+  }
+
