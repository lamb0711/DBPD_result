Requiring lucene index to be created before the region

At the moment, adding an AsyncEventQueue after a region is created has
issues - See GEODE-404.

Therefore, in order to create a lucene index programmatically, the
lucene index needs to be created before the region exists so that we can
create the AEQ ahead of time.

With this change, when an LuceneIndex is created, the actual creation is
deferred in a RegionListener callback. When the region is created, we
add the AEQ to the region attributes and create the colocated regions.

-      if (aeq == null) {
-        AsyncEventQueue indexQueue = factory.create(aeqId, listener);
-        dataRegion.getAttributesMutator().addAsyncEventQueueId(aeqId);
-      } else {
-        logger.info("The AEQ "+aeq+" is created at another member");
-      }
+      AsyncEventQueue indexQueue = factory.create(aeqId, listener);
