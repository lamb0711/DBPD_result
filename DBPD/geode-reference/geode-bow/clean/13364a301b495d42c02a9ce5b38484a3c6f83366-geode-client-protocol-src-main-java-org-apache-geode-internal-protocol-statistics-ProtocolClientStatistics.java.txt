GEODE-4290 add operation time statistics to the protobuf server

Time spent processing operations is now captured using System.nanoTime().

+
+  /**
+   * Invoke this at the start of an operation and then invoke endOperation in a finally block
+   */
+  long startOperation();
+
+  /**
+   * record the end of an operation. The parameter value should be from startOperation and
+   * endOperation must be invoked in the same thread as startOperation because we're using
+   * System.nanoTime()
+   */
+  void endOperation(long startOperationTime);
