GEODE-7623: Preventing recursion in alert generation

After the change to send alerts in a executor, there was a possibiltiy for
sending alerts to generate new alerts, resulting an in infinite loop.

Setting the AlertingAction threadlocal in the executor thread that is sending
alerts, to prevent recursion.

Adding a test that we do not generate recursive alert messages.

-    AlertingAction.execute(() -> doAppend(event));
+    doAppend(event);
