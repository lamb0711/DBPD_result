GEODE-7553: Review membership interfaces/classes and add javadocs wheâ€¦ (#4559)

* GEODE-7553: Review membership interfaces/classes and add javadocs where needed

* adding more javadocs

* use package-info.java instead of package.html

- * GMSMember is the membership identifier class for Group Membership Services.
+ * GMSMember contains data that is required to identify a member of the cluster.
+ * Unfortunately it is also used in identifying client caches in a client/server
+ * configuration and so contains weird things like a durable-id and a durable-timeout.
