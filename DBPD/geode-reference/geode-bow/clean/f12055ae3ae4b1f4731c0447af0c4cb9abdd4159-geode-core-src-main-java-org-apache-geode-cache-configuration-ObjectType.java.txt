* refactor AlterRegionCommand to use ResultModel and RegionConfig
* only alter region in the same group as the region is created on
* when cluster configuration is enabled, if region does not exist in CC, the command would error out.
* The command would no longer alter region not created by gfsh command
* add more unit tests

+import org.apache.geode.cache.Cache;
+
+ * ObjectType represents either a string or an object represented by the DeclarableType
+
+  public Object newInstance(Cache cache) {
+    if (string != null) {
+      return string;
+    }
+
+    if (declarable != null) {
+      return declarable.newInstance(cache);
+    }
+
+    return null;
+  }
