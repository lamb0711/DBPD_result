GEODE-1426: remove sqlf code from GemFireCacheImpl

The sqlf instance variables in GemFireCacheImpl
and all subsequent callers of them have been removed.

-    boolean commitSuccessful = false;
-        commitSuccessful = true;
-          commitSuccessful = true;
-      //Asif: If commit is successful then only remove the tx state
-      // else we expect a rollback to be issued . This is necessary for Sqlfabric 
-      //so that GFETransaction object behaves properly. presently adding this check
-      //only for sqlfabric, but may be this should hold true for GFE. Need to check if
-      //GFE in such cases send the rollback message or not.
-      if (commitSuccessful || !cache.isSqlfSystem()) {
-        txMgr.removeHostedTXState(txId);
-      }
+      txMgr.removeHostedTXState(txId);
