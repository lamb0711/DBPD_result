GEODE-1178 Unexpected DistributedSystemDisconnectedException caused by RejectedExecutionException

This has been reported to JGroups.  While they're deciding what to do about
it I have coded a workaround in our StatRecorder class.  StatRecorder sits
in the JGroups stack just above the transport protocol that is throwing this
exception from its down() method.  StatRecorder will now catch the exception
and, after sleeping a short amount of time (10ms) it will retry as long as
the Manager is not shutting down.

+    this.config = null;

+    this.healthMon = null;
+    this.messenger = null;
