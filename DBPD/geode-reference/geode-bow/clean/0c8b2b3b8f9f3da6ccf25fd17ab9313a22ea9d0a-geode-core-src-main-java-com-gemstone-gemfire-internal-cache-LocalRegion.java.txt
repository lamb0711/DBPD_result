GEODE-1830: Use event, not entry, to check for a tombstone

In LocalRegion.basicPutPart2, check for a TOMBSTONE using
EntryEvent.getNewValue. Previously we were checking the
RegionEntry.isTombstone, but in the case of a PROXY region, the
RegionEntry is marker that does not set isTombstone to true.

-    final boolean invokeCallbacks = !entry.isTombstone(); // put() is creating a tombstone
+    //Invoke callbacks only if we are not creating a tombstone
+    final boolean invokeCallbacks = event.basicGetNewValue() != Token.TOMBSTONE;
