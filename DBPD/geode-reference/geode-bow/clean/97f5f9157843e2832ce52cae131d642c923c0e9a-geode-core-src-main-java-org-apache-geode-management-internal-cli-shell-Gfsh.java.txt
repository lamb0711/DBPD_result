GEODE-6470: Making double-checked locking thread-safe (#3252)

        * A repeated check on a non-volatile field is not thread-safe, and could result in unexpected behavior.
	* Fixed using volatile and local variables
-  private static Gfsh instance;
+  private static volatile Gfsh instance;
-    if (instance == null) {
+    Gfsh localGfshInstance = instance;
+    if (localGfshInstance == null) {
-        if (instance == null) {
-          instance = new Gfsh(launchShell, args, gfshConfig);
-          instance.executeInitFileIfPresent();
+        localGfshInstance = instance;
+        if (localGfshInstance == null) {
+          localGfshInstance = new Gfsh(launchShell, args, gfshConfig);
+          localGfshInstance.executeInitFileIfPresent();
+          instance = localGfshInstance;
