GEODE-1304: remove TODO OFFHEAP comments

Tickets have been filed with the information from the removed comments.

This checkin does change LocalRegion validatedCreate/Put/Destroy
to no longer do an offheap release; instead the calling method does.

-    // TODO OFFHEAP MERGE: the fix for 49555 did the following:
-//       if (listener instanceof LocalRegion) {
-//         LocalRegion lr = (LocalRegion)listener;
-//         if (lr.isDestroyed()) {
-//           // do not added destroyed region to fix bug 49555
-//           return;
-//         }
-//       }
-// need to figure out where this code should now be
