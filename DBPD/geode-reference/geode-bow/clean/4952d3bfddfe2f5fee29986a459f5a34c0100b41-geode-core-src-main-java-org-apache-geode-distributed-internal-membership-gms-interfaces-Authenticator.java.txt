GEODE-6883: Removing some dependencies on core from membership

* Removing some direct dependencies on classes outside of membership.
* Replaced the pattern having each Service implement MessageHandler and
  have a single processMessage method with a switch statement. Instead
  we install individual MessageHandlers for each message.
* Removed GMSAuthenticator from Services. Instead we inject the
  Authenticator when we create a MembershipManager.
