GEODE-1893 remove ability to create a locator without all location services

Deprecated API options for creating a locator without peerLocation or
serverLocation handlers.  There will be documentation work to do since
the docs mention this in at least one place.

-            null, null, null, address, (Properties) null, peerLocator, serverLocator,
-            hostnameForClients, LOAD_SHARED_CONFIGURATION);
+            null, null, null, address, (Properties) null, hostnameForClients);
