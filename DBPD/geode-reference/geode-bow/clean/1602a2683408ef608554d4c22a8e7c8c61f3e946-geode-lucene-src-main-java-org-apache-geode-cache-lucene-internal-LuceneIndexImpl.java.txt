GEODE-2674: Changing the lucene listener to fetch the value from the region

Rather than use the value that is in the queue, use the latest value
from the region to update the lucene index.

This ensures that even if the queue contains spurious events due to
retries or other issues, we put the correct value in the index.

This also potentially saves memory and disk space for the queue, because
the queue does not need to hold the value for the entry.
