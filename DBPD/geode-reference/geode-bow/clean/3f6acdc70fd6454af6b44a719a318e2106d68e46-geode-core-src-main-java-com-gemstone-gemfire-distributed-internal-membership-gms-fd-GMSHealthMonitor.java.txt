Performance enhancements ported from GemFire 8.2.0.x

This increases throughput in GMSMembershipManager by avoiding write-locks
on the view in some places.

I also found GMSHealthMonitor was mistakenly referencing a CORBA class's "debug"
static variable and found an out-of-date comment in AnalyzeSerializablesJUnitTest.

-          if (debug) {
-            logger.debug("HealthMonitor: server replied OK.");
-          }
+          logger.debug("HealthMonitor: server replied OK.");
-          if (debug) {
-            logger.debug("HealthMonitor: server replied ERROR.");
-          }
+          logger.debug("HealthMonitor: server replied ERROR.");
