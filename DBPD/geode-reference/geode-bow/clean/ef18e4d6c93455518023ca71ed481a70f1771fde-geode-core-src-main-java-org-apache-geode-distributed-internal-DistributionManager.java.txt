GEODE-6823 Hang in ElderInitProcessor.init()

This corrects elder init processing to use the isCloseInProgress to
check for shutdown.  A coding error during refactoring caused it to check the
isCloseInProgress() method, which did more than just return the value of
the isCloseInProgress variable and was incorrectly reporting a close in progress
during startup operations.

I've renamed the old isCloseInProgress() method to avoid similar coding
errors in the future and added a new implementation that merely returns
the value of the field, as you'd expect it to do.

While writing tests I found that the ClusterElderManagerTest was leaving
blocked threads behind because the waitForElder() method in
ClusterElderManager was not interruptable.  I've changed that method to
be interruptable.  We don't interrupt message-processing threads so this
should be a safe change.

-  ElderState getElderState(boolean force);
+  ElderState getElderState(boolean force) throws InterruptedException;
