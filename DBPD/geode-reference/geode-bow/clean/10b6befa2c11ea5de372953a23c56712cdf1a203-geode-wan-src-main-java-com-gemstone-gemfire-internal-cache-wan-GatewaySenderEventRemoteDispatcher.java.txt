GEODE-478: Adding a stat for resized gateway batches

Adding a stat to track when we resize a gateway sender batch if it is
too large. Updating the test of resizing a batch to test that the stat
is incremented.

+    GatewaySenderStats statistics = this.sender.getStatistics();
+        statistics.incBatchesResized();
