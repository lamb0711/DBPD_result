GEODE-4819: Separating authorization out from protobuf handlers (#1674)

Separating out authentication from the logic of parsing protobuf
messages. All region operations should be done through the new
AuthenticatingCache API, which does authentication and the operation.

In a future change we should move AuthenticationCache to the core and
refactor gfsh, the REST API, and the old client to also go through this
layer.

+import org.apache.geode.internal.protocol.protobuf.v1.authentication.NoSecurityAuthorizer;
-  private ProtobufConnectionStateProcessor nextConnectionState() {
+  private ProtobufConnectionStateProcessor nextConnectionState(
+      MessageExecutionContext executionContext) {
+      executionContext.setAuthorizer(new NoSecurityAuthorizer());
-      executionContext.setConnectionStateProcessor(nextConnectionState());
+      executionContext.setConnectionStateProcessor(nextConnectionState(executionContext));
