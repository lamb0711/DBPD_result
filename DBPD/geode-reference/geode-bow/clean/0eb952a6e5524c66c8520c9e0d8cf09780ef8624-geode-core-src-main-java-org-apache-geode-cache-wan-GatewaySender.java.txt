GEODE-1984: Fix Issue Make GatewaySender destroy a public API

    1. Making destory API public
    2. Added a new gfsh WAN command destroyGatewaySender
    3. Impleted GatewaySenderDestroyFunction, which first stop gatewaysender
       and then call destroy on the same.
    4. Added a WAN Rest Controller for destroy gatewaysender
    5. Removed the need of explicit casting of sender to AbstractGatewaySender for calling
       destroy API
    6. Renamed Test WanCommandCreateGatewaySenderDUnitTest to WanCommandCreateDestroyGatewaySenderDUnitTest
    7. Each applicable test now also calls destroy gfsh command and verfies the result
    8. Minor changes in the logging for each tests

+  /**
+   * Destroys the GatewaySender. Before destroying the sender, caller needs to to ensure that the
+   * sender is stopped so that all the resources (threads, connection pool etc.) will be released
+   * properly. Stopping the sender is not handled in the destroy. Destroy is carried out in
+   * following steps: 1. Take the lifeCycleLock. 2. If the sender is attached to any application
+   * region, throw an exception. 3. Close the GatewaySenderAdvisor. 4. Remove the sender from the
+   * cache. 5. Destroy the region underlying the GatewaySender.
+   * <p>
+   * In case of ParallelGatewaySender, the destroy operation does distributed destroy of the QPR. In
+   * case of SerialGatewaySender, the queue region is destroyed locally.
