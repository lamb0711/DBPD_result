GEODE-11: Refactor CollectorManager interface

CollectorManager creates new collectors and merges results of the collectors.
Earlier the merge result type could be different from the collector type.
CollectorManager could actually use a collector itself to merge the results.
That way the actions on members and search coordinator will be the same.

-    entries.addHit(new EntryScore(key, score));
+    collect(new EntryScore(key, score));
+  }
+  
+  public void collect(EntryScore entry) {
+    entries.addHit(entry);
