GEODE-216: Handle any exception that might be thrown

The old code was trying to prevent a deadlock under some certain
conditions. But if it can not get a PR because of an exception
then a deadlock is not possible. So the new code just catches
and ignores exceptions and falls through to the code that will
process the message the old way. This code will encounter the
same exception and has the proper logic to handle it.

+      } catch (RuntimeException ignore) {
+        // fix for GEODE-216
+        // Most likely here would be RegionDestroyedException or CacheClosedException
+        // but the cancel criteria code can throw any RuntimeException.
+        // In all these cases it is ok to just fall through and return the
+        // old executor type.
