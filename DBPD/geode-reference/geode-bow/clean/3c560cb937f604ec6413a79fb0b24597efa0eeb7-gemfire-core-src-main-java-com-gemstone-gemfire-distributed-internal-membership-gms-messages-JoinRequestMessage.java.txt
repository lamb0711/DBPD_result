-  public JoinRequestMessage(InternalDistributedMember coord, InternalDistributedMember id, Object credentials) {
+  public JoinRequestMessage(InternalDistributedMember coord,
+      InternalDistributedMember id, Object credentials) {
+    // preserve the multicast setting so the receiver can tell
+    // if this is a mcast join request
+    out.writeBoolean(getMulticast());
+    setMulticast(in.readBoolean());
