Making File and ChunkKey DataSerializableFixedId

These classes should implement DataSerializableFixedId for efficient
serialization. As part of this change, I also added a section to
LuceneServiceImpl's constructor to register all DataSerializableFixedId
classes in the lucene service.

+  public static final short LUCENE_CHUNK_KEY = 2169;
+  public static final short LUCENE_FILE = 2170;
+
