GEODE-642: fix race in OffHeapStorageJUnitTest

The problem was caused by the listener not rechecking the system
property every time it was notified of an OutOfOffHeapMemoryException.
Since the code that disconnects the distributed system when
we run out of off-heap memory is async the test would intermittently pass.

-    private final boolean stayConnectedOnOutOfOffHeapMemory = Boolean.getBoolean(STAY_CONNECTED_ON_OUTOFOFFHEAPMEMORY_PROPERTY);
-        if (stayConnectedOnOutOfOffHeapMemory) {
+        if (Boolean.getBoolean(STAY_CONNECTED_ON_OUTOFOFFHEAPMEMORY_PROPERTY)) {
