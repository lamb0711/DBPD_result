GEODE-2136: Don't duplicate cookies in the http response

We had some code that copied cookies from the request to the response.
That caused us to include a potentially stale cookie value in the
response.

Adding a unit test that we don't screw up the users cookies. I had to
bring in a dependency on httpunit, because the HttpTester with jetty is
not correctly parsing multiple Set-Cookie headers.

-      // Clear out all old cookies and just set ours
-
-      // Replace all other cookies which aren't JSESSIONIDs
-      if (cookies != null) {
-        for (Cookie c : cookies) {
-          if (manager.getSessionCookieName().equals(c.getName())) {
-            continue;
-          }
-          response.addCookie(c);
-        }
-      }
