GEODE-5157: use distributedMember as client ID

Changed the client to put stats information in the monitoring region
using the DistributedMember instead of the toString of
DistributedMember. On the server, if that fails, the toString of
DistributedMember is used, for backward compatibility.

This closes #2218

+import org.apache.geode.distributed.DistributedMember;
+    DistributedMember clientMemberId = proxyId.getDistributedMember();
-    ClientHealthStats stats = (ClientHealthStats) clientHealthMonitoringRegion.get(clientName);
+    ClientHealthStats stats = (ClientHealthStats) clientHealthMonitoringRegion.get(clientMemberId);
+    if (stats == null) {
+      // Clients older than Geode 1.8 put strings in the region, rather than ids
+      // See GEODE-5157
+      stats = (ClientHealthStats) clientHealthMonitoringRegion.get(clientName);
+    }
