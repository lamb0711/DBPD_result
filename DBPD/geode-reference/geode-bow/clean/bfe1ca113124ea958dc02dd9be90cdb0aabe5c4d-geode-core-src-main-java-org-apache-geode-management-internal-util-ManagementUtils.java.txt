GEODE-8240: Member Identifier Future Versions

Inability of member identifiers to hold future versions caused 
problems in rolling upgrades. Now member identifiers hang on 
to a VersionOrdinal which is a base type for Version "enum".
-        member -> ((InternalDistributedMember) member).getVersionObject().compareTo(version) >= 0)
+        member -> ((InternalDistributedMember) member).getVersionOrdinalObject()
+            .compareTo(version) >= 0)
