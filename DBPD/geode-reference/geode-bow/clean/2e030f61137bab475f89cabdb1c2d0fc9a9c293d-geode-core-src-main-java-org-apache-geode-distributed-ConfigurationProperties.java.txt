+   * </p>
+   * <U>Description</U>: This setting is a comma delimited list of component names which works in
+   * conjunction with
+   * the {@link #SECURITY_MANAGER} properties. if security manager is enabled, this property will
+   * determine what rest end point will use token based authentication instead of basic
+   * (username/password)
+   * authentication.
+   * </p>
+   * <U>Componant names</U>: "all","management" <U>Since</U>: Geode 1.11
+   * "all": shorthand for all the security components that support token authentication.
+   * "management": the {@link #ENABLE_MANAGEMENT_REST_SERVICE Management REST Service}
+   *
+   * Note: listing components that are not enabled does nothing.
+   *
+   * Default: empty. All security components use basic (username/password) authentication
