GEODE-1209: Changes to ignoreEvictionAndExpiration AEQ attribute based on the new proposal
(changing ignoreEvictionAndExpiration to forwardExpirationDestroy).

GEODE-1209 was proposed to add new attribute ignoreEvictionAndExpiration to AsyncEventQueue.
As mentioned in the ticket due to product issue a new proposal was made to change the
functionality, to only forward expiration-destroy operation.

The changes made here replaces ignoreEvictionAndExpiration attribute to forwardExiprationDestroy.

-    this.attrs.ignoreEvictionAndExpiration = asyncQueueCreation.isIgnoreEvictionAndExpiration();
+    this.attrs.forwardExpirationDestroy = asyncQueueCreation.isForwardExpirationDestroy();
-  public AsyncEventQueueFactory setIgnoreEvictionAndExpiration(boolean ignore) {
-    this.attrs.ignoreEvictionAndExpiration = ignore;
+  public AsyncEventQueueFactory setForwardExpirationDestroy(boolean forward) {
+    this.attrs.forwardExpirationDestroy = forward;
