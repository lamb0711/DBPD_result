GEODE-5674: Stop using random values for test ports (#2958)

It seems our test framework will fairly frequently have test failing due to
multiple users trying to bind the same port number.  This happens when the
different users happen to randomly generate the same port.  To keep this from
happening, this change will simply hand out the available ports consecutively
as the test runs.  For dunit tests, each child vm will be given a portion of
the overall range for their use.
+import org.apache.geode.internal.AvailablePortHelper;
+      AvailablePortHelper.initializeUniquePortRange(vmNum + 2); // hacky, locator is -2
