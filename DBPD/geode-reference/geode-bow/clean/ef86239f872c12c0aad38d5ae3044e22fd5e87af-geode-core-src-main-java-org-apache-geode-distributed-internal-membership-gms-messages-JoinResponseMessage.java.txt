GEODE-2193 a member is kicked out immediately after joining

The problem is happening because we send a shutdown message, initiating
election of a new coordinator, but the old ViewCreator is allowed to
send out a view announcing a new member.  The new coordinator manages
to send out a new view before the old ViewCreator sends out the new
member's view.  Other members ignore the old ViewCreator's view
because its view ID is old.  Then the reject the new member because
it has an old view ID and it isn't in their membership view.

initial view ID is x

new coordinator prepares view x+10
old coordinator prepares view x+1
other members install x+10, reject view x+1
new member joins in view x+1 when it receives view-prepare message
new member is rejected by other members because x+1 < x+10

+// TODO this class has been made unintelligible with different combinations of response values.
+// It needs to have an enum that indicates what type of response is in the message or it
+// needs to be broken into multiple message classes.
+// 1. a response saying the member has now joined
+// 2. a response indicating that the coordinator is now a different process
+// 3. a response containing the cluster encryption key
