GEODE-7736: Remove depencies on core from MembershipOnlyTest and add two member test (#4621)

* Don't use geode-core serializer and IDM in MembershipOnlyTest

These two classes are not necessary in the MembershipOnlyTest. As part of this
change, I discovered that StaticSerialization was swizzling some class names
for old client support during serialization but not during deserialization.
Fixing that.

* Registering DSFIDS inside MembershipLocatorBuilder.create

We need the locator to register all of the necessary DSFIDs with it's
serializer when it is starting.

* Giving a separate DSFID to MemberIdentifierImpl

Using a separate DSFID for this class, rather than using the same id as
InternalDistributedMember.

*  Adding a test of two members connecting to MembershipOnlyTest
