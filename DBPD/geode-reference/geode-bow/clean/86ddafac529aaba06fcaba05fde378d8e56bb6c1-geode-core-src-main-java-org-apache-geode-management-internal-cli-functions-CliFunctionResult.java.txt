GEODE-4131: Do not reference deployed jars as byte arrays anymore (#1212)

* GEODE-4131: Do not reference deployed jars as byte arrays anymore

- All jars are streamed between locators and servers using the RMIIO library.
- Whenever an upload happens (either deploying jars or importing cluster
  config) we stage the files initially and then proceed with the command.
-  public CliFunctionResult(final String memberIdOrName, final byte[] byteData,
-      final Serializable[] serializables) {
-    this.byteData = byteData;
-    this.serializables = serializables;
-    this.successful = true;
-  }
