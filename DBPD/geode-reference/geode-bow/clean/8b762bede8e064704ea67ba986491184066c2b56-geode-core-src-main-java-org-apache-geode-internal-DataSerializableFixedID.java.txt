GEODE-2538: Don't deserialize values on the server when getting results

If values on the server are in serialized form, leave them that way and
only deserialize the values on the clients.

This is implemented by having the LuceneGetPageFunction extract the
serialized value and return the results in a new PageResults class,
which handles the deserialization and upwrapping of the value if
necessary.
