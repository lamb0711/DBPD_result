GEODE-3948 Improve CQ performance under flaky network conditions

This adds a new PoolFactory setting allowing subscription connections to
time out and initiate failover to a backup server. The new setting is
setSubscriptionTimeoutMultiplier:

A server has an inactivity monitor that ensures a message is sent to a client at least once a
minute (60,000 milliseconds). If a subscription timeout multipler is set in the client it
enables timing out of the subscription feed with failover to another server.

A value of zero (the default) disables timeouts

A value of one will time out the server connection after one of its ping intervals (not
recommended)

A value of two or more will time out the server connection after that many ping intervals have
elapsed

The client/server handshake is modified for clients having version 1.5 or
later. The server sends its ping-interval setting to the client. The client
then uses this and the multiplier to establish a read-timeout in the
CacheClientUpdater subscription processor.

Two tests are added to ensure that 1) the Message method that allows a
read to timeout functions correctly and 2) the CacheClientUpdater
correctly receives the multiplier setting.

This closes #1364
