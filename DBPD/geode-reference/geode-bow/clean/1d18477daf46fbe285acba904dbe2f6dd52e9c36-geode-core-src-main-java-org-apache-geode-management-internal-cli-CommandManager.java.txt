GEODE-6310 limit classgraph file descriptor consumption (#3124)

 * properly wraps all scanner uses in try-with-resources to ensure
   temporary files are cleaned up and file descriptors are closed

 * limits thread usage based on heap size, cpu count, and max file
   descriptor limits

 * removes usage of a non-public classgraph API, to ensure
   binary-compatibility with versions of classgraph up to 4.4.12

* based on review feedback, simplify to just always use 1 thread
