GEODE-4819: Separating authorization out from protobuf handlers (#1674)

Separating out authentication from the logic of parsing protobuf
messages. All region operations should be done through the new
AuthenticatingCache API, which does authentication and the operation.

In a future change we should move AuthenticationCache to the core and
refactor gfsh, the REST API, and the old client to also go through this
layer.
