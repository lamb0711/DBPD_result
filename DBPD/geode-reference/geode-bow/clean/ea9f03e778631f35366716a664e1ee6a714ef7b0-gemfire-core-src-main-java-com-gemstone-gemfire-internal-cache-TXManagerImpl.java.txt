Fix GEODE-186 by removing sleeps in tests

The old test scheduled tx suspension to timeout after 1 minute.
So the test always run for at least 1 minute.
A test hook now exists that allows the test to specify
a different time unit (default is still minutes) for
tx suspension expiration.

The sleeps in a bunch of other tests were not needed
since the tx operation is synchronous. So those sleeps
have simply been removed.

A couple of sleeps in clients waiting for something to
arrive that was done on a server have been converted to
a wait since server to client distribution is async.
