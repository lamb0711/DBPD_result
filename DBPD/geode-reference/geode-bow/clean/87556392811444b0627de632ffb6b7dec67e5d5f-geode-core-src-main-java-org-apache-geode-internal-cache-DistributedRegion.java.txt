GEODE-5843 ReconnectDUnitTest.testReconnectWithRequiredRoleRegained is being ignored

Two problems have been addressed:
  First, the recursive reconnect logic in InternalDistributedSystem was
  broken.  After recursion created a new cache the higher up reconnect()
  method did not handle things correctly and called things like
  createAndStartCacheServers() on the defunct cache and notifying
  reconnect-listeners that the defunct DistributedSystem had been
  successfully created.  The test for
  reconnecting after role-loss was also messed up and needed to have
  its end conditions changed a bit.

  Second, the execution of role-loss actions was being done under a
  synchronization on the distribution advisor.  That was periodically
  causing a deadlock if we receive an update for the distribution advisor.

This closes #2588
