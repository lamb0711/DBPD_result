GEODE-6573: move methods from ConnectionManager to Connection (#3375)

Connection now has default implementations of getWrappedConnection,
activate, and passivate. ConnectionManager no longer has these methods.

+import org.apache.geode.InternalGemFireException;

+  /**
+   * If this connection wraps another connection then
+   * return the wrapped connection.
+   * If this connection does not wrap then return this.
+   *
+   * @return the wrapped connection or this connection
+   * @throws ConnectionDestroyedException if the wrapped connection no longer exists
+   */
+  default Connection getWrappedConnection() {
+    return this;
+  }
+
+  /**
+   * Mark the connection as being actively used.
+   *
+   * @return true if connection activated, false if could not be activated because it is destroyed
+   * @throws InternalGemFireException when the connection is already active
+   */
+  default boolean activate() {
+    return true;
+  }
+
+  /**
+   * Mark the connection as one that is not being used.
+   *
+   * @param accessed true if the connection was used while active
+   * @throws InternalGemFireException when the connection is already passive
