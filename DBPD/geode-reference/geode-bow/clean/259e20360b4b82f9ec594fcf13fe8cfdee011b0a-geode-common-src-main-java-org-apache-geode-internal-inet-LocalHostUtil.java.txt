GEODE-8158: change redis to listen on all local addresses by default (#5204)

Enhanced LocalHostUtil to support anyLocalAddress. 
Changed redis to have its default bind address to be anyLocalAddress instead of a single local address.
+import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
+   * Returns the special address that can be used to bind to all local addresses.
+   * In most cases this will be "0.0.0.0".
+   */
+  public static InetAddress getAnyLocalAddress() {
+    return new InetSocketAddress(0).getAddress();
+  }
+
+  /**
+      } else if (inetAddress.isAnyLocalAddress()) {
+        return true;
