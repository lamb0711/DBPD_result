GEODE-2787: When distribution happened, it calls startOperation() to increase a count, then call an endOperation() to decrease the count.

state flush will wait for this count to become 0.

But notifyGateway() is called after distribute(). So there's race that stateflush finished but notifyGateway has not done yet.

The fix is to move the endOperation() after callbacks.

+        // before distribute: DR's put, it has notified gateway sender earlier
+          // before distribute: DR.destroy, hasSeenEvent. no to notifyGateway
+        // before distribute: DR.destroy, it has notifiedGatewaySender ealier
+          // before distribute: DR.invalidate, it has triggered callback earlier
+        // before distribute: DR has sent callback earlier
+   * @return token >0 means startOperation finished distribution
-  public void postPutAllSend(DistributedPutAllOperation putAllOp,
+  public long postPutAllSend(DistributedPutAllOperation putAllOp,
+    long token = -1;
-      putAllOp.distribute();
+      token = putAllOp.startOperation();
+    return token;
-  public void postRemoveAllSend(DistributedRemoveAllOperation op,
+  public long postRemoveAllSend(DistributedRemoveAllOperation op,
+    long token = -1;
-      op.distribute();
+      token = op.startOperation();
+    return token;
