Revert "GEODE-7953: Restore Redundancy Internal API (#4909)" (#5006)

This reverts commit 0f9918510b24f2169189936a92951b9bb4f313f1.
-import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
-   * Creates a {@link RestoreRedundancyOperation} class for defining and starting restore redundancy
-   * operations and for determining the redundancy status of regions. Similar to a rebalance
-   * operation, a restore redundancy operation will attempt to bring each included region to its
-   * configured redundancy level by creating redundant copies of buckets, and will also optionally
-   * reassign which members host the primary buckets for better load balancing. A restore redundancy
-   * operation differs from a rebalance operation in that it will not move buckets from one member
-   * to another.
-   *
-   * @return a class for defining and starting restore redundancy operations
