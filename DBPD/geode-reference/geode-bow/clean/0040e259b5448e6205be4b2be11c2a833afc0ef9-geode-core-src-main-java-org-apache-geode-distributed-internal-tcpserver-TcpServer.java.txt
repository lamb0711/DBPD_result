GEODE-3583: Marking static variables final that are never modified

To help reduce the number of mutable statics to look through, adding
final to all of the statics that are not actually mutated outside of a
static initializer.

This change *only* consists of adding final to these variables.

-  private static int MAX_POOL_SIZE =
+  private static final int MAX_POOL_SIZE =
-  private static int POOL_IDLE_TIMEOUT = 60 * 1000;
+  private static final int POOL_IDLE_TIMEOUT = 60 * 1000;
