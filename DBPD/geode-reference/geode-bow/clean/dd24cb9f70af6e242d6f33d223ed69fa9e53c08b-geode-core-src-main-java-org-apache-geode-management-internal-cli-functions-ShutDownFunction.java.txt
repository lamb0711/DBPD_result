GEODE-4374: Allow client calls to complete before shutting down (#1354)

- This adds a small delay in the async shutdown function so that any client
  responses can be sent. This avoids client getting some form of disconnect
  exception during shutdown.
+      try {
+        // Allow the function call to exit so we don't get disconnect exceptions in the client
+        // making the call.
+        Thread.sleep(1000);
+      } catch (InterruptedException ignore) {
+      }
