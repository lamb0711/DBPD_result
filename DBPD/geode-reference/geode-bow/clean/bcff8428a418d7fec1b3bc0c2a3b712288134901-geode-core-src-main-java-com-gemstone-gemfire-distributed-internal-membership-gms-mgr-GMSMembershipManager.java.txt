GEODE-1129: DistributionManagerDUnitTest.testAckSevereAlertThreshold is disabled

Reenabling the test and altering the beSick test-hook to no longer disable
accepting of TCP/IP connections but, instead, buffer cache operations in
the membership manager to cause severe-alerts to be issued.

+import com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.cache.partitioned.PartitionMessageWithDirectReply;
+      if (beingSick || playingDead) {
+        // cache operations are blocked in a "sick" member
+        if (msg.containsRegionContentChange() || msg instanceof PartitionMessageWithDirectReply) {
+          startupMessages.add(new StartupEvent(msg));
+          return;
+        }
+      }
-      beingSick = false;
-      playingDead = false;
