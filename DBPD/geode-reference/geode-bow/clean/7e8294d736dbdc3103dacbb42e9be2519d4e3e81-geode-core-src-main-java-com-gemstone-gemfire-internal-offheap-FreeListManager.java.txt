-   * TODO OFFHEAP: what should be done about contiguous chunks that end up being bigger than 2G?
-   * Currently if we are given slabs bigger than 2G or that just happen to be contiguous and add
-   * up to 2G then the FreeListManager may unify them together into a single Chunk and our 32-bit chunkSize
-   * field will overflow. This code needs to detect this and just create a chunk of 2G and then start
-   * a new one.
-   * Or to prevent it from happening we could just check the incoming slabs and throw away a few bytes
-   * to keep them from being contiguous.
