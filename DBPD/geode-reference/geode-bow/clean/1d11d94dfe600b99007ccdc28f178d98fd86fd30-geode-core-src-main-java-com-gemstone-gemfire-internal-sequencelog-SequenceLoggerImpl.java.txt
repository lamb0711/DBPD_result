GEODE-1458: Prevent sequence logger from launching and closing a thread

The sequence logger code was launching a thread from a static block,
even if it was not enabled. The thread was then immediately dying.
Fixing the code to not launch the thread unless it is enabled, and to
not die immediately if it is.

-  private static final SequenceLogger INSTANCE;
+  private static final SequenceLoggerImpl INSTANCE;
-  public static final String ENABLED_TYPES_PROPERTY = "gemfire.GraphLoggerImpl.ENABLED_TYPES";
+  public static final String ENABLED_TYPES_PROPERTY = "gemfire.SequenceLoggerImpl.ENABLED_TYPES";
-    if (INSTANCE != null) {
-      ((SequenceLoggerImpl)INSTANCE).consumerThread.interrupt();
+    if (INSTANCE != null && INSTANCE.consumerThread != null) {
+      INSTANCE.consumerThread.interrupt();
-    consumerThread = new ConsumerThread();
-    consumerThread.start();
+    if(!enabledTypes.isEmpty()) {
+      consumerThread = new ConsumerThread();
+      consumerThread.start();
+    }
-        GemFireCacheImpl cache = GemFireCacheImpl.getInstance();
-        if (cache == null || cache.isClosed()) {
-          if (appender != null) {
-            appender.close();
-          }
-          break;
-        }
