GEODE-6719 : Handling default disktore request from AppServers (#3516)

* If the existing region was using the DEFAULT diskstore but it was not explicitly linked to the
   * region using setDiskStore or disk-store-name tags. diskStoreName is set as null. This is
   * interpreted by Geode as use the DEFAULT diskstore.
   * This link between the existing region and a diskstore may happen because the diskstore is
   * named as DEFAULT.
   * The user may change the default location of the DEFAULT diskstore but the AppServer always
   * requests it be at the default location.
   * This comparison with always used to fail and the AppServer could not start up.
   * The goal of this method is that if both existing region and requested region are using the
   * DEFAULT diskstore, the existing regions take precedence and the requested ones are ignored.
   * This is current behavior which can be seen in
   * {@link RegionAttributesCreation#sameAs(RegionAttributes)}
   * The logic is to intercept the configurations for the regions and only if the both the regions
   * have diskStoreName set to null, meaning both should use the DEFAULT diskstore, the diskstore
   * names are sent as DEFAULT in the configuration and send to geode-core for comparison for rest
   * of the region attributes.
