Hiding the lucene async event queue from the list of queues.

I added a new flag to the queue - isMetaQueue, which controls whether a
queue will show up in getAllQueues. This also has the effect of
preventing the queue from showing up in a generated xml file.

This is necessary because our queue needs to be constructed with an
async event listener that has a reference to the index. If the queue is
generated and added to the xml, it will end up trying to create a
listener before the index is created.

-      asyncEventQueue = new AsyncEventQueueImpl(sender, listener);
-      ((GemFireCacheImpl) cache).addAsyncEventQueue(asyncEventQueue);
+      AsyncEventQueueImpl queue = new AsyncEventQueueImpl(sender, listener);
+      asyncEventQueue = queue;
+      ((GemFireCacheImpl) cache).addAsyncEventQueue(queue);
+  public AsyncEventQueueFactory setIsMetaQueue(boolean isMetaQueue) {
+    this.attrs.isMetaQueue = isMetaQueue;
+    return this;
+  }
