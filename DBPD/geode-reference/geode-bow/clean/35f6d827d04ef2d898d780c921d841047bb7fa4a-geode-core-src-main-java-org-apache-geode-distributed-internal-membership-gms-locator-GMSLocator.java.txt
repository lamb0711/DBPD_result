GEODE-2534 concurrently started locators fail to create a unified system

GMS services were being installed in the locator before they were started,
causing the locator to not know its own member ID.  This caused the
concurrent startup registry to not contain its member ID, allowing
FindCoordinatorResponses to be incorrect.

+          localAddress);
