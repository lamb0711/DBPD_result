Overhauling the javadocs for the LuceneService

Enhancing the javadocs with more detailed descriptions of what the
classes do, adding links to lucene classes where appropriate, and
removing some cruft that didn't match the current implementation.

This closes #410

- * Provides wrapper object of Lucene's Query object and execute the search.
- * Instances of this interface are created using {@link LuceneQueryFactory#create}.
- * 
+ * A query on a Lucene index. Instances of this interface are created using
+ * {@link LuceneQueryFactory#create}. Once this query is constructed, use one of the find methods to
+ * find region entries that match this query.
+ * </p>
+ * <p>
+ * Instances obtained from {@link LuceneQueryFactory} are immutable, so they are safe for reuse and
+ * can be shared by multiple threads.
+ * </p>
+ * <p>
+ * Because Lucene indexes are maintained asynchronously, results returned from the find methods may
+ * not reflect the most recent updates to the region.
+ * </p>
+ * <p>
+ * Results are returned in order of their score with respect to this query. See
+ * {@link org.apache.lucene.search} for details on how Lucene scores entries.
+ * </p>
-   * Execute search and return keys.
+   * Execute the query and return the region keys that match this query, up to the limit specified
+   * by {@link #getLimit()}.
+   * 
+   * @throws LuceneQueryException if the query could not be parsed or executed.
-   * Execute search and return values.
+   * Execute the query and return the region values that match this query, up to the limit specified
+   * by {@link #getLimit()}
+   * 
+   * @throws LuceneQueryException if the query could not be parsed or executed.
-   * Execute search and return list of LuceneResultStruct.
+   * Execute the query and return a list of {@link LuceneResultStruct}s that match this query, up to
+   * the limit specified by {@link #getLimit()} A {@link LuceneResultStruct} contains the region
+   * key, value, and a score for that entry.
+   *
+   * @throws LuceneQueryException if the query could not be parsed or executed.
-   * Execute the search and get results.
+   * Execute the query and get a {@link PageableLuceneQueryResults}. The
+   * {@link PageableLuceneQueryResults} provides the ability to fetch a page of results at a time,
+   * as specified by {@link #getPageSize()}
+   *
+   * @throws LuceneQueryException if the query could not be parsed or executed.
