GEODE-7379: Remove TcpServer dependencies on CancelException. (#4259)

- CancelException has been removed, using IllegalStateException instead.
- The usage of CancelException had nothing to do with cancelling operations
  and was deemed unneeded.


-    final String locatorCancelExceptionString =
-        "This could be the result of trying to connect a non-SSL-enabled client to an SSL-enabled locator.";
-
-      throw new LocatorCancelException("Unable to form SSL connection", e);
+      throw new IllegalStateException("Unable to form SSL connection", e);
-          throw new LocatorCancelException(
-              "Server version response invalid: " + locatorCancelExceptionString);
+          throw new IllegalThreadStateException(
+              "Server version response invalid: "
+                  + "This could be the result of trying to connect a non-SSL-enabled client to an SSL-enabled locator.");
