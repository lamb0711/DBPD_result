* GEODE-7553: Review membership interfaces/classes and add javadocs where needed

* adding more javadocs

* use package-info.java instead of package.html

+/**
+ * A membership coordinator will send InstallViewMessages to other members when a node
+ * in the cluster joins or leaves. There are three types of IVMs:<br>
+ * 1) PREPARE informs other member of the intent to change membership. All members of the
+ * cluster are required to respond to this message. A non-responding member will be suspect and
+ * may be kicke out of the cluster. A member may respond to a PREPARE message to object
+ * due to having received a conflicting PREPARE message.<br>
+ * 2) INSTALL informs other members that all of the nodes recorded in the membership "view" have
+ * responded to a PREPARE message and that the enclosed view defines the current cluster.<br>
+ * 3) SYNC messages are periodically broadcast to ensure that all members of the cluster
+ * know the current cluster membership.<br>
+ * The first two types of InstallViewMessage require a ViewAckMessage in response.
