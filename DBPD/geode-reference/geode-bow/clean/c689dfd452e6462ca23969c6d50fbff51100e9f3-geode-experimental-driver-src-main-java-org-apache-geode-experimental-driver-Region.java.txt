GEODE-2999, GEODE-4836: Add PutIfAbsent to the Protobuf protocol.

fix issues with getRequest not properly returning null.

This reverts commit 7a3da494e3b506e8cd485999db7a3cd42e200f85, which
originally reverted 6214a43be9d31fd0be1d133a8f0ad7379ea3f9c2.

This closes #1617

+   * @return null if the value was set; the current value otherwise.
+   *         NOTE that if the value in the region was set to null, this method will return null
+   *         without setting a new value.
