GEODE-5783: have a single source for ThreadFactory

Use the keepalive parameter when initializing the thread factory.

I also made some logging changes while debugging the problems this
missing setting was causing.

-      logger.debug("Connection: connected to {} with stub {}", remoteAddr, addr);
+      logger.debug("Connection: connected to {} with IP address {}", remoteAddr, addr);
