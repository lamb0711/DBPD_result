+ * Added boolean flag that when turned on will throw an exception instead of allocating a new
+ * buffer. The exception is a BufferOverflowException thrown from expand, and will restore the

+ * Usage Model: boolean succeeded = true; stream.disallowExpansion(); try {
+ * DataSerializer.writeObject(obj, stream); } catch (BufferOverflowException e) { succeeded = false;
