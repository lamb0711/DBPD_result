Revert "GEODE-8020: buffer corruption in SSL communications (#4994)" (#5027)

This reverts commit ec8db54ad7f342542762beb8f3e912dff44e3a53.

The fix for GEODE-8020 reduced performance in SSL benchmark tests.
Unfortunately this revert leaves SSL communications broken, but there
are no CI tests that show that this is the case.
-    this.myNetData = bufferPool.acquireNonDirectSenderBuffer(packetBufferSize);
+    this.myNetData = bufferPool.acquireDirectSenderBuffer(packetBufferSize);
-      buffer = bufferPool.acquireNonDirectBuffer(bufferType, requiredSize);
+      buffer = bufferPool.acquireDirectBuffer(bufferType, requiredSize);
