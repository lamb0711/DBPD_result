GEODE-6290: change PdxInstance.equals for empty class name (#3091)

PdxInstance.equals will only act as if an instance has a field
with the default value if the class name is not empty.
If the class name is empty it will now require that both instances
have all the same identity fields.
If the class name is empty then neverDeserialize will be called automatically.

-   *        fully deserialized.
+   *        fully deserialized unless {@link PdxInstanceFactory#neverDeserialize()} is called.
+   *        If className is the empty string then no class versioning will be done for that
+   *        PdxInstance and {@link PdxInstanceFactory#neverDeserialize()} will be automatically
+   *        called on the returned factory.
