GEODE-469: Don't log a warning if a region is destroyed during creation

This test saw a suspect string because we logged a warning about a
RegionDestroyedException during region creation. I don't think this
warning should be logged, we don't log warnings for CancelExceptions.

-      } catch (CancelException e) {
+      } catch (CancelException | RegionDestroyedException | RedundancyAlreadyMetException e) {
-      } catch(RedundancyAlreadyMetException e) {
-        //don't log this
-        throw e;
