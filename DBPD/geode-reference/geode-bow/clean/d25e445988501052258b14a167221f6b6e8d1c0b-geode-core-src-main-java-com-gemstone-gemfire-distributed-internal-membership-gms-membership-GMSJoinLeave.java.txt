GEODE-1081 remove becomeCoordinator from JoinResponseMessage

We no longer use becomeCoordinator so it is not needed in JoinResponseMessage.
The code reacting to becomeCoordinator in GMSJoinLeave is also not needed
and has been removed.

-    if (response.getBecomeCoordinator()) {
-      logger.info("I am being told to become the membership coordinator by {}", coord);
-      synchronized (viewInstallationLock) {
-        this.currentView = response.getCurrentView();
-        becomeCoordinator(null);
-      }
-      return true;
-    }
