GEODE-4392: Remove catch blocks that immediately rethrow the caught exception. (#1385)

* Optimized imports in touched files.
* Removed some commented-out code, inlined some few variables.
-import org.apache.geode.cache.RegionDestroyedException;
-      } catch (PrimaryBucketException pbe) {
-        // Is this necessary?
-        throw pbe;
-      } catch (RegionDestroyedException e) {
-        throw e;
