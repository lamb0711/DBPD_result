GEODE-8330: Structural Improvements to Versioning

Follow-on to GEODE-8240, this commit eliminates redundancy in 
versioning code and provides a single way to convert a short
to a version and a single way to acquire a known version from
a (possibly unknown) version.
-  /**
-   * If this member runs a version known in this JVM then return that Version.
-   * If this member does not run a known version then return Version.CURRENT.
-   *
-   * In various serialization scenarios we want the well-known version for this
-   * member, or, if it doesn't have a well-known version, we want the current
-   * (in this JVM) software version. Rather than have that logic spread around in
-   * the serialization code, it is centralized here.
