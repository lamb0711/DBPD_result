GEODE-306: support printing of off-heap compressed nodes

Before when a chunk of off-heap compressed memory tried to
get the type of the data stored in the chunk it needed to
decompress the data. Since it did not know what decompressor
to use it threw an UnsupportedOperationException.
Now for a compressed chunk it returns the DataType as either
a "compressed object of size xxx" or "compressed byte[xxx]".
It does not do a decompression.
Unit test coverage was added.

-        return "byte[" + ((Chunk)this.block).getDataSize() + "]";
+        if (isCompressed()) {
+          return "compressed byte[" + ((Chunk)this.block).getDataSize() + "]";
+        } else {
+          return "byte[" + ((Chunk)this.block).getDataSize() + "]";
+        }
+      } else if (isCompressed()) {
+        return "compressed object of size " + ((Chunk)this.block).getDataSize();
