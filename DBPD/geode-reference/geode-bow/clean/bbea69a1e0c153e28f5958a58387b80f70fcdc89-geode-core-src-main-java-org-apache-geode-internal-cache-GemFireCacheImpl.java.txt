GEODE-3540: unable to gfsh destroy gateway-sender (#1414)

   GW sender bean is not unregistered during destroy command which
   is why it appears when you list gateways after destroy. This fix is to 
   unregistered the MX bean from SystemManagementService
+    if (!(sender.getRemoteDSId() < 0)) {
+      this.system.handleResourceEvent(ResourceEvent.GATEWAYSENDER_REMOVE, sender);
+    }
