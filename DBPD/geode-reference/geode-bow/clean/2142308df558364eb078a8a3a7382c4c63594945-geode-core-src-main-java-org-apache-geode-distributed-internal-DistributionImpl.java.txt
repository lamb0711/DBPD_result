GEODE-7552: Break dependency on Services (#4438)

Rewrote locator installation to use Membership rather than the "hidden"
Services interface.

I rewrote some tests to stop using the internal interfaces of membership
as well, and along the way saw that JGroupsMessenger was maintaining a
collection of old identifiers that was only being consumed by a test & I
removed it.
-import org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.membership.adapter.GMSLocatorAdapter;
-  public static void connectLocatorToServices(Services services) {
+  public static void connectLocatorToServices(Membership membership) {
-      if (l.getLocatorHandler().setServices(services)) {
-        services
-            .setLocator(((GMSLocatorAdapter) l.getLocatorHandler()).getGMSLocator());
-      }
+      l.getLocatorHandler().setMembership(membership);
+  public Membership getMembership() {
+    return membership;
+  }
+
+  @Override
-  @Override
-  public Services getServices() {
-    return membership.getServices();
-  }
-
-      connectLocatorToServices(distribution.getServices());
+      connectLocatorToServices(distribution.getMembership());
