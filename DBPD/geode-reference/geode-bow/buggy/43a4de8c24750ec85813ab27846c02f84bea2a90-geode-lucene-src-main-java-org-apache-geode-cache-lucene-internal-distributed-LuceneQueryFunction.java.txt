GEODE-2768: Lucene Queries executed before index is fully created should be retried

  * Added a sleep to prevent rapid retries which lead to stack overflow
  * Sleep can be removed when Function Execution retry does not add to stack

+import org.apache.geode.cache.lucene.internal.LuceneServiceImpl;
+      if (index == null && service instanceof LuceneServiceImpl) {
+        if (((LuceneServiceImpl) service).getDefinedIndex(searchContext.getIndexName(),
+            region.getFullPath()) != null) {
+          // The node may be in the process of recovering, where we have the index defined but yet
+          // to be recovered
+          // If we retry fast enough, we could get a stack overflow based on the way function
+          // execution is currently written
+          // Instead we will add an artificial sleep to slow down the retry at this point
+          // Hopefully in the future, the function execution would retry without adding to the stack
+          // and this can be removed
+          try {
+            Thread.sleep(1000);
+          } catch (InterruptedException e) {
+            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
+          }
+          throw new InternalFunctionInvocationTargetException(
+              "Defined Lucene Index has not been created");
+        }
