GEODE-5922 SerialGatewaySenderQueue concurrency is poorly implemented

Replaced simple synchronization with a fair write-lock.  The use of
sync to enforce serial queueing wasn't fair and caused inconsistent
latency.  I observed one thread that was blocked trying to get the
sync for over 30 seconds while other subsequent threads were able to
get the sync and queue their events.

This closes #2705

-    buffer.append("SenderEventImpl[").append("id=").append(this.id).append(";action=")
+    buffer.append("GatewaySenderEventImpl[").append("id=").append(this.id).append(";action=")
