GEODE-3583: Marking static variables final that are never modified

To help reduce the number of mutable statics to look through, adding
final to all of the statics that are not actually mutated outside of a
static initializer.

This change *only* consists of adding final to these variables.

-  public static boolean ASSIGN_BUCKETS = Boolean.getBoolean(
+  public static final boolean ASSIGN_BUCKETS = Boolean.getBoolean(
-  public static boolean DONT_EXIT_AFTER_LAUNCH = Boolean
+  public static final boolean DONT_EXIT_AFTER_LAUNCH = Boolean
