GEODE-3153 Client receives duplicate events during rolling upgrade

Another problem was found in backward-compatibility testing.  If a
1.0.0 client was receiving subscription events generated by a 1.0.0
peer "feeder" member and the events were routed through a 1.0.0 server
the client might see duplicate events when the server is stopped and
the client fails over to a 1.2.0 server holding its redundant
subscription queue.  This is especially possible if a large "ack"
period is established in the client.

The problem stems from the EventID deserialization/reserialization of
the memberID bytes when sending to a 1.0 client.  It was deserializing
using Version.CURRENT, which ignores the UUID bytes in the serialized ID.
Then it serialized the identifier using the client's version, which
includes the UUID bytes but which are zero due to the version used
in deserialization.

-    if (!VersionManager.isCurrentVersion(version)) {
+    if (VersionManager.isCurrentVersion(version)) {
+      classPath = dunitClasspath;
+    } else {
+      // remove current-version product classes and resources from the classpath
+       String buildDir = separator + "geode-core" + separator + "build" + separator;
+
+       String mainClasses = buildDir + "classes" + separator + "main";
+       dunitClasspath = removeFromPath(dunitClasspath, mainClasses);
+
+       String mainResources = buildDir + "resources" + separator + "main";
+       dunitClasspath = removeFromPath(dunitClasspath, mainResources);
+
+       String generatedResources = buildDir + "generated-resources" + separator + "main";
+       dunitClasspath = removeFromPath(dunitClasspath, generatedResources);
+
+       buildDir = separator + "geode-common" + separator + "build" + separator + "classes"
+       + separator + "main";
+       dunitClasspath = removeFromPath(dunitClasspath, buildDir);
+
+       buildDir = separator + "geode-json" + separator + "build" + separator + "classes" +
+       separator
+       + "main";
+       dunitClasspath = removeFromPath(dunitClasspath, buildDir);
