GEODE-502: Keeping a reference to RMI objects in the dunit framework

My suspicion with this failure is that the GC happened that cleaned up
one of these objects, if the RMI framework is not keeping a strong
reference to the class.

+  private static RemoteDUnitVM dunitVM;
-      Naming.rebind("//localhost:" + namingPort + "/vm" + vmNum, new RemoteDUnitVM());
+      dunitVM = new RemoteDUnitVM();
+      Naming.rebind("//localhost:" + namingPort + "/vm" + vmNum, dunitVM);
