GEODE-247: Fix in executeQuery function to use the bucket parameter and added tests cases for it.

* modification of the function executeQuery to use the parameter bucket rather than ignoring it.
* added integration test QueryWithBucketParameterIntegrationTest which tests variations in the  bucket parameter.
* code improvements done as per the review comments in github pull request
* placed MyValue, createAndPopulateSet and populateRegion into a separate file TestData.java as being reused by two test cases to avoid redundant code
* modified BugJUnitTest to import the TestData package and replaced for loops with IntStreams and lambda functions.

NOTE: This is an internal API which needs to be deprecated and replaced with an API without the bucket parameter.

This closes #117

-      result = this.proxy.executeQuery(query, parameters, getBucketSet());
+      result = this.proxy.executeQuery(query, parameters, buckets);
