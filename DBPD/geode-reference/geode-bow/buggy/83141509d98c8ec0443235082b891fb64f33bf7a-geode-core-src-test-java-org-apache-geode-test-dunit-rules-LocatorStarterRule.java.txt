refactor ServerStarterRule and LocatorStarterRule so that they can be created without a Properties first.

+ * You can create this rule with and without a Property. If the rule is created with a property, the
+ * locator will started automatically for you. If not, you can start the locator by using one of the
+ * startLocator function. Either way, the rule will handle shutting down the locator properly for
+ * you.
+ *
- *
- * <p>
- * You may choose to use this class not as a rule or use it in your own rule (see
- * {@link LocatorServerStartupRule}), in which case you will need to call startLocator() and after()
- * manually.
- * </p>
