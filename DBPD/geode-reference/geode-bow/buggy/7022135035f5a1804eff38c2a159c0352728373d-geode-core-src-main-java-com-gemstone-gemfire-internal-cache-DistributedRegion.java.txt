GEODE-1238: ensure EntryEventImpls are released

-- reviewed all EntryEventImpl creators
-- created two new subclasses to mark ones that are never off-heap
-- added annotations and comments on all creators
-- added missing release calls

+import com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.offheap.annotations.Released;
-    EntryEventImpl event = null;
+    @Released EntryEventImpl event = null;
-        EntryEventImpl holder = EntryEventImpl.createVersionTagHolder();
-        try {
+        VersionTagHolder holder = new VersionTagHolder();
-        } finally {
-          holder.release();
-        }
