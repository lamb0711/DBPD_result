GEODE-3175 backward-compatibility tests fail with bad classpath

Added a printout of the versions loaded by VersionManager when it
initializes.  This will help us figure out why the test runs are failing.

+    System.out
+        .println("VersionManager has loaded the following classpaths:\n" + instance.classPaths);
