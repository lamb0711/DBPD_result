implementation of AvailablePort.isPortAvailable for multicast

The AvailablePort utility has not had support for finding a free multicast
port since feature/GEODE-77 was merged to the develop branch.  This change-
set enables the old multicast code in AvailablePort and implements the
check & response for its datagrams in JGroupsMessenger.  The JGroups
transport method for receiving packets is overridden to look for these
datagrams and respond to them.

I also renamed AvailablePort.JGroups to AvailablePort.MULTICAST, which
describes the kind of port that's being tested a little better.

+  // overridden to implement AvailablePort response
+  @Override
+  public void receive(Address sender, byte[] data, int offset, int length, boolean copy_buffer) {
+    if(data == null) return;
+
+    // drop message from self; it has already been looped back up (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1765)
+    if(local_physical_addr != null && local_physical_addr.equals(sender))
+        return;
+
+    if (length-offset == 4
+        && data[offset] == 'p'
+        && data[offset+1] == 'i'
+        && data[offset+2] == 'n'
+        && data[offset+3] == 'g') {
+      // AvailablePort check
+      data[offset+1] = 'o';
+      try {
+        sendToSingleMember(sender, data, offset, length);
+      } catch (Exception e) {
+        log.fatal("Unable to respond to available-port check", e);
+      }
+      return;
+    }
+
+    super.receive(sender,  data,  offset,  length, copy_buffer);
+  }
