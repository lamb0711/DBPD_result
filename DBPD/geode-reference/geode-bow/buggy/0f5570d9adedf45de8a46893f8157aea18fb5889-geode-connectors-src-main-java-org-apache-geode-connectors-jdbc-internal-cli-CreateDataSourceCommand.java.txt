* Added error for no members found in CreateDataSourceCommand

- Added an error case for when no servers are available when
CreateDataSourceCommand is run and Cluster Config is not enabled

* Fixed error output based on PR feedback

-      return ResultModel.createInfo("No members found.");
+      if (service != null) {
+        return ResultModel.createInfo("No members found, data source saved to cluster config.");
+      } else {
+        return ResultModel.createError("No members found and cluster configuration unavailable.");
+      }
