GEODE-1375 When using multicast a new member needs to receive the multicast message digest

This reinstates the sending of JoinResponseMessages so that the new member
can get the jgroups multicast digest.  The JoinResponseMessages are sent
after installing the new membership view, so JGroupsMessenger has been
changed to use MERGE_VIEW instead of SET_VIEW to install the digest since
it may have already received multicast messages from some members.
