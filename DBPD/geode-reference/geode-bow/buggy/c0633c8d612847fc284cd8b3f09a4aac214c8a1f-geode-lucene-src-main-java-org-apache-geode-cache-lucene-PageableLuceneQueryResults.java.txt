Overhauling the javadocs for the LuceneService

Enhancing the javadocs with more detailed descriptions of what the
classes do, adding links to lucene classes where appropriate, and
removing some cruft that didn't match the current implementation.

This closes #410

- * Defines the interface for a container of lucene query result collected from function
- * execution.<br>
- * 
- * 
+ * This interface allows you to retrieve a page of query results at a time, using the
+ * {@link #hasNext()} and {@link #next()} methods.
+ * </p>
+ *
+ * Each page is fetched individually from the server, so {@link PageableLuceneQueryResults} cannot
+ * be serialized and sent to other members.
+ *
+ * @see LuceneQuery#findPages()
+ *
-   * @return total number of hits for this query
+   * @return total number of hits for this query across all pages.
-   * Returns the maximum score value encountered. Note that in case scores are not tracked, this
-   * returns {@link Float#NaN}.
+   * Returns the maximum score value across all pages.
