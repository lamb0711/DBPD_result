GEODE-762: change default setting for enable-network-partition-detection

This setting now defaults to being turned on.  Some unit tests that perform
HA operations have been modified to disable it.

-  boolean DEFAULT_ENABLE_NETWORK_PARTITION_DETECTION = false;
+  boolean DEFAULT_ENABLE_NETWORK_PARTITION_DETECTION = true;
