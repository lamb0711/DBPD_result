GEODE-996: OffheapStats - fragmentation percentage calculation has to be revisited.

 Offheap fragmentation stat is computed based on
 available fragments compared to max possbile fragments
 which describes how fragmented the current free memory is.

-    final String fragmentationDesc = "The percentage of off-heap memory fragmentation.  Updated every time a compaction is performed.";
+    final String fragmentationDesc = "The percentage of off-heap free memory that is fragmented.  Updated every time a compaction is performed.";
