fixing a test hook for a QueryMonitor unit test

The affected test will be moved to open-source in the up-coming
migration of the continuous-query project to open-source.  The
test hook wasn't quite robust enough and allowed a query that was
canceled to appear, to the test at least, as if it had not been
canceled.

+        
+        if ((testException == null) && (query instanceof DefaultQuery)) {
+          if (((DefaultQuery)query).isCanceled()) {
+            testException = new QueryExecutionTimeoutException("The query task could not be found but the query is marked as having been canceled");
+          }
+        }
-      logger.debug("Removed thread from QueryMonitor. QueryMonitor size is:{}, Thread (id): thread is : {}",
