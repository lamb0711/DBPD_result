GEODE-1600: startLocatorAndDS takes 0 as port number parameter

        * Use of getAvailableTCP port led to race conditions which led to locators being assigned ports in use.
        * Use of 0 now assignes a port number to the locator after the server is started.
        * Code modification to accept 0 as a valid port number until a real port number is assigned after the server is started.
	This closes #202

+  //Reset the file names with the correct port number if startLocatorAndDS was called with port number 0
+  public void resetInternalLocatorFileNamesWithCorrectPortNumber(int port){
+    this.stateFile = new File("locator" + port + "view.dat");
+    File productUseFile = new File("locator"+port+"views.log");
+    this.productUseLog = new ProductUseLog(productUseFile);
+  }
