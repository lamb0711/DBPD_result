GEODE-3139 remove current artifacts from classpath of backward-compatibility tests

This removes the geode-core product artifacts from old-version JVM classpaths
for backward-compatibility testing.  I had to change the distributed test
framework to not refer to InternalClientCache but surprisingly that caused
no compilation failures.

+import org.apache.geode.internal.Version;
-        logger.info("This VM is using Geode version {}", geodeVersion);
+        logger.info("This VM is using Geode version {}. Version.CURRENT is {}", geodeVersion,
+            Version.CURRENT);
