GEODE-77 adding additional test coverage

Test coverage is now > 71% for all membership services.
This also fixes a problem in GMSJoinLeave.join where a member that
was shut down & restarted with a start-locator setting formed a
split-brain.  Now we send a collection of previously attempted
coordinators with FindCoordinator requests, and a member receiving
a join request will check to see if the new member ought to assume
the role of coordinator.  See LocatorDUnitTest.testCollocatedLocatorWithSecurity.

+import java.util.Collection;
-  public InternalDistributedMember memberID;
+  private InternalDistributedMember memberID;
+  private Collection<InternalDistributedMember> rejectedCoordinators;
+  public FindCoordinatorRequest(InternalDistributedMember myId, Collection<InternalDistributedMember> rejectedCoordinators) {
+    this.memberID = myId;
+    this.rejectedCoordinators = rejectedCoordinators;
+  }
+  
+  public Collection<InternalDistributedMember> getRejectedCoordinators() {
+    return rejectedCoordinators;
+  }
+  
-    return "FindCoordinatorRequest(memberID="+memberID+")";
+    if (rejectedCoordinators != null) {
+      return "FindCoordinatorRequest(memberID="+memberID
+          +", rejected="+rejectedCoordinators+")";
+    } else {
+      return "FindCoordinatorRequest(memberID="+memberID+")";
+    }
+    DataSerializer.writeObject(this.rejectedCoordinators, out);
-
+    this.rejectedCoordinators = DataSerializer.readObject(in);
