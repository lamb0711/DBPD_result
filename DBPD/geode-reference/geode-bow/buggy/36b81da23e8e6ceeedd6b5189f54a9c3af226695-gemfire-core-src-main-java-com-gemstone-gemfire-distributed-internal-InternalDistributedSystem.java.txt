GEODE-77 reducing aggressiveness of the health monitor

The health monitor was timing out a peer after not seeing a message from
it in 100ms.  HA testing has shown that this is far too aggressive, with
most test runs dieing a quick and tragic death with all members trying
to kick each other out of the distributed system.

This commit reverts to our old way of waiting member-timeout ms before
giving up on a peer, and adds a final check of the member activity map
before allowing a suspect message to be sent to the coordinator.

-      if (isDebugEnabled) {
-        logger.debug("changing thread name to ReconnectThread"); // wha?! really?
-      }
-      Thread.currentThread().setName("ReconnectThread");
+    if (isDebugEnabled) {
+      logger.debug("changing thread name to ReconnectThread");
+    Thread.currentThread().setName("ReconnectThread");
+    Thread.currentThread().setDaemon(false);
