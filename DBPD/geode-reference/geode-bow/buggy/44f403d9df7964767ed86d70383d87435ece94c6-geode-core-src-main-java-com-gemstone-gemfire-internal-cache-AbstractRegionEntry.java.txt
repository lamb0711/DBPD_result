GEODE-1304: remove TODO OFFHEAP comments

Tickets have been filed with the information from the removed comments.

This checkin does change LocalRegion validatedCreate/Put/Destroy
to no longer do an offheap release; instead the calling method does.

-    @Retained Object result = OffHeapHelper.copyAndReleaseIfNeeded(v); // TODO OFFHEAP keep it offheap?
+    @Retained Object result = OffHeapHelper.copyAndReleaseIfNeeded(v);
-        // TODO OFFHEAP: Review the callers to see if they will handle DataAsAddress correctly.
-            // TODO OFFHEAP: cache data in event?
-              // TODO OFFHEAP: cache data in event?
-            // TODO OFFHEAP: cache data in event?
