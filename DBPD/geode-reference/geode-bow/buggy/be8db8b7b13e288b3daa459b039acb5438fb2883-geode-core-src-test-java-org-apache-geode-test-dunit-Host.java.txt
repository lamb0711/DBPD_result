GEODE-1965 Create backward-compatibility unit test framework

See
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GEODE/Writing+Backward-compatibility+DUnit+tests

This extends the distributed unit test framework to allow you to boot a
VM running an older version of Geode.  Using this extension you can create
rolling upgrade tests, client/server interoperability tests, persistent
store upgrade tests and so on.

VM numbering has not changed.  If you request that a VM use a certain
version of GEODE it will be bounced if necessary and its classpath modified
to point to that version.  The VM will continue to use that version until
bounced to a different version or the next test class is started.  All
VMs are moved to the current version at the beginning of a new test class.

Console output from versioned VMs will contain the symbolic version in use
by the VM, such as "[vm0_v100]" to help you know it is running a different
version of GEODE.

Tests are all compiled with the current Geode code, so if there are API
changes you must use reflection in order to invoke the old versions of
the API.  RollingUpgradeDUnitTests shows how to do this.

ClientServerMiscBCDUnitTest shows how to subclass an existing class to
make it run with multiple versions of Geode.  In this case the clients
are parameterized to run with older versions while servers are held to
the current version.

I will be opening a few tickets to track problems I have already encountered
with these tests.
