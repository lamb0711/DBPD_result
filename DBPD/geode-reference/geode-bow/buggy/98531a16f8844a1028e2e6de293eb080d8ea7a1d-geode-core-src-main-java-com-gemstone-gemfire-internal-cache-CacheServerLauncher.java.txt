GEODE-1816: Workaround to clear statics in CacheCreationJUnitTest

Working around the fact that other tests are leaving static thread
locals set, causing this test to fail. The actual fix is to remove the
static thread locals from the product.

+  public static void clearStatics() {
+    disableDefaultServer.set(null);
+    serverPort.set(null);
+    serverBindAddress.set(null);
+  }
+
