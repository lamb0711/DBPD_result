GEODE-2213 Deadlock in GMSJoinLeaveJUnitTest

This removes the informToPendingJoinRequests invocation in recordViewRequest.
I was already testing this change as I suspected that this invocation was
causing new members to timeout trying to connect to the distributed system
due to informToPendingJoinRequests removing join requests from the view
creator's queue.

-      if (viewCreator != null) {
-        boolean joinResponseSent = viewCreator.informToPendingJoinRequests();
-
-        if (!joinResponseSent && request instanceof JoinRequestMessage) {
+      if (viewCreator != null && services.getMessenger().getClusterSecretKey() != null) {
+        if (request instanceof JoinRequestMessage) {
-              // TODO [bruce] if the view creator is just spinning up I don't think we should do
-              // this remove
-              iterator.remove();
