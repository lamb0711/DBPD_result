GEODE-6759: Prevent Deleting Pool Still in Use and Fix NPE in Function Execution (#3569)

* GEODE-6759: Avoid Deleting Pools Still in Use

- Fixed minor warnings.
- Added unit and integration tests.
- Replaced the usage of `junit.Assert` by `assertj`.
- PoolManagerImpl now checks whether the pool is being used or not
  before unregistering it.
- InternalFunctionExecutionServiceImpl now throws a meaningful
  exception if the pool can not be found instead of NPE.
+    // Continue only if the pool is not currently being used by any region and/or service.
+    int attachCount = ((PoolImpl) pool).getAttachCount();
+    if (attachCount > 0) {
+      throw new IllegalStateException(String.format(
+          "Pool could not be destroyed because it is still in use by %s regions", attachCount));
+    }
