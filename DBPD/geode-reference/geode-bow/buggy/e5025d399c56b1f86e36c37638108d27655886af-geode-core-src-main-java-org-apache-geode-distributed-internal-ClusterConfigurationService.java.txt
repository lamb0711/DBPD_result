GEODE-4765: Add retries when retrieving cluster config (#1539)

- This helps when a locator is reconnecting to the distributed system and isn't
  fully ready yet.
- During reconnect, pass a fresh cache to the ClusterConfigurationService -
  this fixes the 'DLock destroyed' issue.
- Also fixes GEODE-4730

+import org.apache.geode.distributed.LockServiceDestroyedException;
-  private final DistributedLockService sharedConfigLockingService;
+  private DistributedLockService sharedConfigLockingService;
-    boolean isLocked = this.sharedConfigLockingService.lock(SHARED_CONFIG_LOCK_NAME, 5000, 5000);
+    boolean isLocked = lockSharedConfiguration();
-      this.sharedConfigLockingService.unlock(SHARED_CONFIG_LOCK_NAME);
+      unlockSharedConfiguration();
