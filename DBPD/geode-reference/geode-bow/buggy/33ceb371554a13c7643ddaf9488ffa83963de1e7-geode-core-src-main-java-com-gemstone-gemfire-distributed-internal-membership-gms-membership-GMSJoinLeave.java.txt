GEODE-1542 shared/unordered tcp/ip connection times out, initiating suspicion

This disables timing out of shared/unordered TcpConduit connections.  We don't
want them to time out because we are using them to initiate suspect processing
on other members.

The ticket also pointed out a problem with the "final check" mechanism in
the health monitor.  I tracked that down to improper use of SocketCreator
to create the server-socket in GMSHealthMonitor.  It was creating sn SSL
socket if SSL is enabled but the client-side of the check uses non-SSL
sockets.  I changed the server to use non-SSL sockets as well since no
useful information is sent over the final-check TCP/IP connections & they
need to be lightweight and fast.

While looking at logs I also found that the heartbeat request sent at the
beginning of a final-check had a request-ID even though it's not waiting
for a response.  That causes processing of the response to do more work
than necessary so I changed it to remove the request-ID from the message.

-      logger.debug("JoinLeave is checking to see if I should become coordinator");
+      logger.debug("Checking to see if I should become coordinator");
-      logger.debug("JoinLeave is checking to see if I should become coordinator");
+      logger.debug("Checking to see if I should become coordinator");
-    logger.debug("JoinLeave is recording the request to be processed in the next membership view");
+    logger.debug("Recording the request to be processed in the next membership view");
-          logger.debug("JoinLeave sending a leave request to {}", coords);
+          logger.debug("Sending my leave request to {}", coords);
