GEODE-7157: SSLConfigurationFactory thread-safe

By removing deprecated
SSLConfigurationFactory::getSSLConfigForComponent()
method with SecurableCommunicationChannel input argument
the static distributedConfig and registeredSSLConfig
members are not needed anymore and therefore the
thread-safety for this class is guaranteed just by
protecting the access to the "instance" member.

- * the setters plus the build() method of its inner {@link SSLConfig.Build} class.
+ * {@link SSLConfig.Builder} class.
-  private Properties properties = new Properties();
+  private final Properties properties;
+  /**
+   * Builder class to be used to construct SSLConfig instances.
+   * In order to build an {@link SSLConfig} instance an instance of this
+   * class must be created, then the corresponding setter methods invoked
+   * and finally the build() method that returns the {@link SSLConfig} instance
+   *
+   * Example:
+   * SSLConfig sslConfInstance = new SSLConfig.Builder()
+   * .setAlias(alias)
+   * .setKeystore(keystore)
+   * ...
+   * .build();
+   *
