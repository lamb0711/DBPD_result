GEODE-3801: Use hardlinks for backup oplog files (#963)

* GEODE-3801: Use hardlinks for backup oplog files

  * Oplog files that are backed up are read-only. For this reason,
    they can be transfered to the backup location through hard links,
    instead of copying the file. This change improves speed of backups.
    If the creation of a hard link fails, we revert to the existing copy
    behavior.
  * During backups, the copying of the oplog's krf file was being done while
    that file could still be in the process of writing. This change ensures
    that if a krf is to be written, that it is finished and included in the
    backup
  * cleanup existing oplog tests
