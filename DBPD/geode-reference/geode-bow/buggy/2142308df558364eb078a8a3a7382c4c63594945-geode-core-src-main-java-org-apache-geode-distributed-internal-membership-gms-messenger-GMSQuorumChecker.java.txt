GEODE-7552: Break dependency on Services (#4438)

Rewrote locator installation to use Membership rather than the "hidden"
Services interface.

I rewrote some tests to stop using the internal interfaces of membership
as well, and along the way saw that JGroupsMessenger was maintaining a
collection of old identifiers that was only being consumed by a test & I
removed it.
-  private Set<MemberIdentifier> oldMemberIdentifiers;
-  public GMSQuorumChecker(GMSMembershipView jgView, int partitionThreshold, JChannel channel,
-      Set<MemberIdentifier> oldMemberIdentifiers) {
+  public GMSQuorumChecker(GMSMembershipView jgView, int partitionThreshold, JChannel channel) {
-    this.oldMemberIdentifiers = oldMemberIdentifiers;
-    return new MembershipInformationImpl(channel, oldMemberIdentifiers, messageQueue);
+    return new MembershipInformationImpl(channel, messageQueue);
