GEODE-3052 Need to reset isCoordinator flag in GMSLocator.

isCoordinator flag ensures that this process is becoming the
coordinator thus other process should join this process. But
when network parttion happens, we were not resetting this flag.

Now we reset isCoordinator flag when viewCreator thread shutdowns.

added unit test for it.

+            logger.debug("this member is becoming coordinator from view {} ", fromView);
