GEODE-6423 availability checks sometimes immediately initiate removal

Ensure that the availability check is performed for the contracted
member-timeout period.  This allows a suspect to survive the check if
it's having a momentary glitch like a brief garbage-collection, or if
there is short network outage.

This change caused some "reconnect" tests to fail due to short
auto-reconnect intervals letting disconnected nodes start reconnecting
before suspect processing completed on the force-disconnected nodes.
I've fixed this by reinitializing the UUID part of the membership ID in
JGroupsMessenger during reconnect attempts.

-        UUID logicalAddress = (UUID) myChannel.getAddress();
-        if (logicalAddress instanceof JGAddress) {
-          ((JGAddress) logicalAddress).setVmViewId(-1);
+        // attempt to establish a new UUID in the jgroups channel so the member address will be
+        // different
+        try {
+          Method setAddressMethod = JChannel.class.getDeclaredMethod("setAddress");
+          setAddressMethod.setAccessible(true);
+          setAddressMethod.invoke(myChannel);
+        } catch (SecurityException | NoSuchMethodException e) {
+          logger.warn("Unable to establish a new JGroups address.  "
+              + "My address will be exactly the same as last time. Exception={}",
+              e.getMessage());
-        myChannel.connect("AG"); // apache g***** (whatever we end up calling it)
+        myChannel.connect("AG"); // Apache Geode
-
+    logger.info("Established local address {}", localAddress);
