GEODE-1599: Array size allocation method was changed to prevent race condition in CopyOnWriteArray

	* toArray(new Statistics[statlist.size()]); was converted to toArray(new Statistics[0]);
	* This is done to avoid a race condition.
	* The size of the CopyOnWriteArray may increase after allocating the size for the array in which the CopyOnWriteArray is to be placed

-    return (Statistics[])statsList.toArray(new Statistics[statsList.size()]);
+    return (Statistics[])statsList.toArray(new Statistics[0]);
