GEODE-2828: AEQ created before the Lucene user regions

	* AEQ is being created before the Lucene user region
	* A countdown latch prevents the index repository computation until the user regions are ready
	* Integration tests do not use a Dummy executor because we need a thread pool for afterPrimary call.

	This closes #481

-  static private final DummyExecutor executor = new DummyExecutor();
+  static private final ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
