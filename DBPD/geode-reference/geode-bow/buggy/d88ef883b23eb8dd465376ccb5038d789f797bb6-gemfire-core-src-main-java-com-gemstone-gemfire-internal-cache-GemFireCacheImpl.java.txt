Hiding the lucene async event queue from the list of queues.

I added a new flag to the queue - isMetaQueue, which controls whether a
queue will show up in getAllQueues. This also has the effect of
preventing the queue from showing up in a generated xml file.

This is necessary because our queue needs to be constructed with an
async event listener that has a reference to the index. If the queue is
generated and added to the xml, it will end up trying to create a
listener before the index is created.

+  
+  /**
+   * The list of all async event queues added to the cache. 
+   * CopyOnWriteArrayList is used to allow concurrent add, remove and retrieval operations.
+   */
+  private volatile Set<AsyncEventQueue> allVisibleAsyncEventQueues = new CopyOnWriteArraySet<AsyncEventQueue>();
-  public void addAsyncEventQueue(AsyncEventQueue asyncQueue) {
+  public void addAsyncEventQueue(AsyncEventQueueImpl asyncQueue) {
+    if(!asyncQueue.isMetaQueue()) {
+      this.allVisibleAsyncEventQueues.add(asyncQueue);
+    }
-    return this.allAsyncEventQueues;
+    return this.allVisibleAsyncEventQueues;
+      this.allVisibleAsyncEventQueues.remove(asyncQueue);
