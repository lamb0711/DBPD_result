New unit tests & minor bugfixes

1) new unit tests
2) detection of IDs w/o UUIDs in them in UDP messaging
3) removal of JoinResponse messages - view messages are considered a join-response so we don't need to send both
4) detection of new members admitted by a different coordinator during becomeCoordinator processes (problem found by Jianxia)
5) adjusting the join-timeout if member-timeout is large

+import com.gemstone.gemfire.distributed.internal.membership.gms.membership.GMSJoinLeave;
+
+  /** stall time to wait for concurrent join/leave/remove requests to be received */
+  public static final long MEMBER_REQUEST_COLLECTION_INTERVAL = Long.getLong("gemfire.member-request-collection-interval", 500);

-  private int joinTimeout;
+  private long joinTimeout;
-  public int getJoinTimeout() {
+  public long getJoinTimeout() {
-    int defaultJoinTimeout = 24000;
+    long defaultJoinTimeout = 24000;
-    joinTimeout = Integer.getInteger("p2p.joinTimeout", defaultJoinTimeout).intValue();
+    
+    // we need to have enough time to figure out that the coordinator has crashed &
+    // find a new one
+    long minimumJoinTimeout = dconfig.getMemberTimeout() * 2 + MEMBER_REQUEST_COLLECTION_INTERVAL;
+    if (defaultJoinTimeout < minimumJoinTimeout) {
+      defaultJoinTimeout = minimumJoinTimeout;
+    };
+    
+    joinTimeout = Long.getLong("p2p.joinTimeout", defaultJoinTimeout).longValue();
