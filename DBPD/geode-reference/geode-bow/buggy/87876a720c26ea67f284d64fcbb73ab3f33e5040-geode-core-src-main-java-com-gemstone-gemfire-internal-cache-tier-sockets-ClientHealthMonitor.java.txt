GEODE-1546: fix issue when a proxy server was shut down before its scheduled task of removing departed client is invoked.

Move transactionTimeToLive setting into TXManagerImpl.
Update proxy server to track the latest proxy after failover.
Expire client transactions if they do not fail over to new proxy servers and after transaction timeout period.
Add test cases for the above scenario.
Refactored the test code and made transactionTimeToLive setting adjustable to reduce test running time.

-   * transactionTimeToLive setting that is inherited from the CacheServer.
+   * transactionTimeToLive setting that is inherited from the TXManagerImpl.
-    CacheClientNotifier notifier = CacheClientNotifier.getInstance();
-    if (notifier == null || this._cache.isClosed()) {
-      return; // notifier is null when shutting down
+    if (this._cache.isClosed()) {
+      return; 
-    long timeout = notifier.getTransactionTimeToLive() * 1000;
-    if (txids.size() > 0) {
+    long timeout = txMgr.getTransactionTimeToLive() * 1000;
+    if (!txids.isEmpty()) {
