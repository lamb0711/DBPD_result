Revert "GEODE-6477: Reply with exception if exception occurred during processing the message. (#3258)"
Do not change the existing product behavior as other places send the message as well.
Instead I will open a new ticket to handle the issue seen during gii.

This reverts commit a441757759819afa1fcfc3a36e10d4f22e762abe.

-      exception = new ReplyException(e);

-      ReplyMessage replyMsg = createReplyMessage();
+      ReplyMessage replyMsg = new ReplyMessage();
