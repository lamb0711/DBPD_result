GEODE-77 reducing aggressiveness of the health monitor

The health monitor was timing out a peer after not seeing a message from
it in 100ms.  HA testing has shown that this is far too aggressive, with
most test runs dieing a quick and tragic death with all members trying
to kick each other out of the distributed system.

This commit reverts to our old way of waiting member-timeout ms before
giving up on a peer, and adds a final check of the member activity map
before allowing a suspect message to be sent to the coordinator.

-  /**
-   * If member don't see any activity from particular member then it sends check request
-   * to that member. And then it waits for "geode.member-check-timeout" time for response
-   * from it. If that member doesn't respond then it issues suspect request for it. 
-   */
-  private static final long MEMBER_CHECK_TIMEOUT = Long.getLong("geode.member-check-timeout", 100);

-            pingResp.wait(MEMBER_CHECK_TIMEOUT);
+            pingResp.wait(services.getConfig().getMemberTimeout());
+            // double check the activity log
+            CustomTimeStamp ts = memberVsLastMsgTS.get(pingMember);
+            if (ts != null &&
+                ts.getTimeStamp()
+                  > (System.currentTimeMillis() - services.getConfig().getMemberTimeout())) {
+              return true;
+            }
