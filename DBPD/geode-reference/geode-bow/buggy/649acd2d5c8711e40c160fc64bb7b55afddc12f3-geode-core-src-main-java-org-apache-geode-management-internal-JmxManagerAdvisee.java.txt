GEODE-7157: SSLConfigurationFactory thread-safe

By removing deprecated
SSLConfigurationFactory::getSSLConfigForComponent()
method with SecurableCommunicationChannel input argument
the static distributedConfig and registeredSSLConfig
members are not needed anymore and therefore the
thread-safety for this class is guaranteed just by
protecting the access to the "instance" member.

-              SSLConfigurationFactory.getSSLConfigForComponent(SecurableCommunicationChannel.JMX);
+              SSLConfigurationFactory.getSSLConfigForComponent(dc,
+                  SecurableCommunicationChannel.JMX);
