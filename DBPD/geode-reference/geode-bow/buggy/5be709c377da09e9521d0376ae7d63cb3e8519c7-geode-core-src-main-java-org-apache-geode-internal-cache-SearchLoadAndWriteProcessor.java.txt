GEODE-4295: convert loaded PdxInstance (#1453)

If a loader returns a PdxInstance, and if
the cache has pdx-read-serialized false,
then the PdxInstance is now deserialized
by calling PdxInstance.getObject.
So a "get" of a loaded PdxInstance will now
only be a PdxInstance if pdx-read-serialized
is true or if PdxInstance.getObject returns
a PdxInstance.

+        obj = this.region.getCache().convertPdxInstanceIfNeeded(obj);
+              // no need to call convertPdxInstanceIfNeeded since we are serializing
+              // this into the NetLoadRequestMessage. The loaded object will be deserialized
+              // on the other side and have the correct form in that member.
