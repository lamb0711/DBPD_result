GEODE-7938: added keys query param to GET, PUT, and DELETE /{region} endpoints (#4901)

* added keys query param to GET, PUT, and DELETE /{region} endpoints
* when getting multiple keys, results are now ordered as the request was ordered
* the code that tests for missing keys now uses the getAll result instead of sending multiple messages and having a race in which key is deleted after the old check but before getAll
* Added endpoint for PUT {region}?keys=encodedKey&op=CREATE. The CREATE is a new op.
This allows users to create entries that have an encodedKey. Before they could only create using POST and its key was never decoded.
