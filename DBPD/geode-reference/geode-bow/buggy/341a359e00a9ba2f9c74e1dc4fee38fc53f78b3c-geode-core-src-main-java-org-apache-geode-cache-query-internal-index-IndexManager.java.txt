GEODE-1272 Don't deserialize PDX objects when creating an index

Setting the flag to prevent deserialization of PDX objects while
populating an index that is defined on a partitioned region. We were
setting this flag in the member that initially created the index, but
not in other members that receive the IndexCreationMessage.

This closes #318

+    boolean oldReadSerialized = DefaultQuery.getPdxReadSerialized();
+    DefaultQuery.setPdxReadSerialized(true);
+      DefaultQuery.setPdxReadSerialized(oldReadSerialized);
