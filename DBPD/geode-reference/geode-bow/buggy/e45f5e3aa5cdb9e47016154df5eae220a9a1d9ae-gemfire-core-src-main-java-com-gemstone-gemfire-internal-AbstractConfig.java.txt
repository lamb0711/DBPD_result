GEODE-405: sameAs needs to ignore ssl-* properties

Since toProperties does not include ssl-* properties
sameAs needs to also ignore ssl-* properties.
Since the ssl-* are always copied to cluster-ssl-*
and sameAs compares these it will still return false
if the ssl-* properties had different values.

+      if (this.isDeprecated(attName)) {
+        // since toProperties skips isDeprecated sameAs
+        // needs to also skip them.
+        // See GEODE-405.
+        continue;
+      }
