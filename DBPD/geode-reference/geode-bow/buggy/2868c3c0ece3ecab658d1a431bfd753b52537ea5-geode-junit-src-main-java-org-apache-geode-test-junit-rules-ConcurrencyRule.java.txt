GEODE-5585: Check that threads have been run (#2332)

* GEODE-5585: Check that threads have been run

In the ConcurrencyRule's after(), check that all threads that have been
added have been run, to protect from tests having false passes due to
threads never being executed and results gathered. If tests really need
to be added and not run, clear() must be used before after() is invoked.


+import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicBoolean;
+  private final AtomicBoolean allThreadsExecuted = new AtomicBoolean(false);
+
+    allThreadsExecuted.set(false);
+    allThreadsExecuted.set(false);
-  protected void after() {
+  protected void after() throws IllegalStateException {
+    if (allThreadsExecuted.get() == Boolean.FALSE) {
+      throw new IllegalStateException("Threads have been added that have not been executed.");
+    }
+    allThreadsExecuted.set(false);
+    allThreadsExecuted.set(true);
+    allThreadsExecuted.set(true);
+    allThreadsExecuted.set(true);
