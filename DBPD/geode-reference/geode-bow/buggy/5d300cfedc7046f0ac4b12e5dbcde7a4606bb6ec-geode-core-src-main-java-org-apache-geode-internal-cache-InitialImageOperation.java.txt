GEODE-6802: Execute region synchronization on newly joined member. (#3623)

 * Region sync will be invoked to avoid data inconsistency on a newly joined/restarted member
   if it received a region synchronization request from other members due to timed task.
 * Use a flag in RegionVersionHolder to ensure only one such call is executed.
 * Make sure RVV exception is filled for persistent member requesting region sync. (This may
   leads to CommitConflictException on some transactions on persistent regions due to this
   region sync operation. But it should be rare and is acceptable compared to data inconsistency
   issue.)
