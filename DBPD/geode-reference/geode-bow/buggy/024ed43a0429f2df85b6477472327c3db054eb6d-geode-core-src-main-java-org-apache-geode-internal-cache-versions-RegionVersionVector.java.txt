GEODE-5278 Unexpected CommitConflictException caused by faulty region synchronization

Modified RegionVersionVector.contains(id,version) to answer true
if the vector is for sychronization and the ID is that of the owner
of the vector.  This causes the get-initial-image code to ignore entries
last changed by the server requesting the synch operation.

+      if (isForSynchronization()) {
+        // a sync vector only has one holder & no valid version for the vector's owner
+        return true;
+      }
