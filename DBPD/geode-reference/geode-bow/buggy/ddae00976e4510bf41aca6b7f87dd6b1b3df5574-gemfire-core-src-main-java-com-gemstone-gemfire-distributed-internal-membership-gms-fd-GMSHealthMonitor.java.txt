GEODE-77 reduced some health monitor logging to trace level

During HA events I observed the health monitor create in excess of 1gb of
log entries per second.  That's way too much for debug-level logging.

-          logger.debug("Checking member {} ", neighbour);
+          logger.trace("Checking member {} ", neighbour);
-          logger.debug("Setting next neighbour as member {} has not responded.", pingMember);
+          logger.trace("Setting next neighbour as member {} has not responded.", pingMember);
-    logger.debug("Checking member {}", pingMember);
+    logger.trace("Checking member {}", pingMember);
-        logger.debug("Member {} is not part of current view.", pingMember);
+        logger.trace("Member {} is not part of current view.", pingMember);
-      logger.debug("Next neighbour to check is {}", nextNeighbour);
+      logger.trace("Next neighbour to check is {}", nextNeighbour);
