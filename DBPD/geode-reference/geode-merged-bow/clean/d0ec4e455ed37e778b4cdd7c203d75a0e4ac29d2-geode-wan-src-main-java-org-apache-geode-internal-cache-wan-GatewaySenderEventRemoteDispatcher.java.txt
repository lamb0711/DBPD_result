GEODE-5270: Shutting down the AckThread (#2017)

* Shutting down the ack thread reader
	* If the ack thread reader is up and running and ends up reading the close messages response that the stomper thread is trying to send out in the same connection
	* This may result in two threads reading from the same connection and end up with OOME
