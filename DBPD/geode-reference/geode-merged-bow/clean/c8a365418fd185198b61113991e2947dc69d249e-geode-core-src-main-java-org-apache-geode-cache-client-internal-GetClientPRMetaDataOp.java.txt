    GEODE-3249: Validate internal client/server messages

    This was merely a matter of changing the server to require the credentials
    and changing the client to send credentials.  I removed the general overriding
    of AbstractOp.processSecureBytes() because it made no sense.  If the server
    sends a secure byte "part" in a message the client is obligated to process
    it or the next message it sends will cause a security violation.

    I've added a server-side property that folks can set to allow old clients
    to continue to work.  This must be used to roll the servers forward to the
    new version that contains this change.  Clients must then be rolled
    forward & the servers can then be rolled once again without the property set.

    The system property is
      geode.allow-internal-messages-without-credentials=true

(cherry picked from commit 6be38cad729d56f355c7586ec994bfef933c5e65)

-    protected void processSecureBytes(Connection cnx, Message message) throws Exception {}
-
-    @Override
