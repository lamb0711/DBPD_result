GEODE-6570 processing of cached join request delays view installation

Ignore join requests from a member that's already joined.  Also, never
overwrite an established vmViewID in a member's ID because the member
knows about the old vmViewID and will ignore the newly assigned number.

-              joinPorts.put(mbr, port);

+                // already joined in a previous view
+                logger.info("Ignoring join request from member {} who has already joined", mbr);
+              } else {

+                joinPorts.put(mbr, port);
