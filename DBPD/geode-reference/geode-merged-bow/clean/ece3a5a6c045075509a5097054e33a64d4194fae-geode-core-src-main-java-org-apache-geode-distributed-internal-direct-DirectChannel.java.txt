GEODE-8238: message loss during shutdown in Shutdown Hook when JVM exits (#5232)

Remove invocation of removeEndpoint when a shared/unordered connection
shuts down.  Endpoint cleanup is already initiated by DistributionImpl
during membership view installation, so it isn't needed here.
+
-  public void closeEndpoint(InternalDistributedMember member, String reason) {
-    closeEndpoint(member, reason, true);
-  }
