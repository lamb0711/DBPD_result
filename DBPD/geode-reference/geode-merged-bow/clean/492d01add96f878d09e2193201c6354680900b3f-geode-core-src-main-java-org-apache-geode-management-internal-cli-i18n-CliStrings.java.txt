GEODE-2594: do not use Attach API or tools.jar by default

* remove tools.jar from classpath in gfsh and gfsh.bat
* remove use of Attach API from start commands
* deprecate --pid option in help of status and stop commands

If a user still wants to use the --pid option in status or
stop commands then they can manually add the tools.jar to
their classpath before launching gfsh.
