GEODE-223: Handle region create/destroy remote event in Redis adpater

Ignore events where region creation initiated remotely attempts to create a local region reference when the region has already been destroyed. Also, the destruction of a region may be caught the query engine, so I have accounted for that by handling com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.query.RegionNotFoundException. Finally, a the Jedis client timeout has been increased for RedisDistDunitTest to account for concurrent region creation/destruction and an expected exception has been added to not fail over the log scanning. Sometimes when a region is destroyed the PooledMessage Processor will log a regiondestroyed exception, which is ok, but makes the test fail.

closes #16

+import com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.query.RegionNotFoundException;
-        if (e instanceof RegionDestroyedException || e.getCause() instanceof QueryInvocationTargetException)
+        if (e instanceof RegionDestroyedException || e instanceof RegionNotFoundException || e.getCause() instanceof QueryInvocationTargetException)
