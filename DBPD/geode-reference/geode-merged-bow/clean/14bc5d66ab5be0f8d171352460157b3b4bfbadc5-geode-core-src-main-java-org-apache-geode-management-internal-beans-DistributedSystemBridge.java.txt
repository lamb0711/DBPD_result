GEODE-6196 Replace use of org.json with Jackson JSON library

removed TypedJson, replacing with QueryResultFormatter

most of TypedJson's internals were replaced so I just renamed it to
QueryResultFormatter to better show its intended purpose.

QueryResultFormatter uses a Jackson ObjectMapper so it will pay
attention to Jackson annotations placed on classes to be serialized.

Object traversal depth is limited to the element-count being passed
by the QueryDataFunction function.  Element-count in collections
are also limited.  There is a new constructor that lets you specify
separate elementCount and serializationDepth parameters.

-import org.apache.geode.management.internal.cli.json.TypedJson;
-  private int queryCollectionsDepth = TypedJson.DEFAULT_COLLECTION_ELEMENT_LIMIT;
+  private int queryCollectionsDepth = QueryDataFunction.DEFAULT_COLLECTION_ELEMENT_LIMIT;
