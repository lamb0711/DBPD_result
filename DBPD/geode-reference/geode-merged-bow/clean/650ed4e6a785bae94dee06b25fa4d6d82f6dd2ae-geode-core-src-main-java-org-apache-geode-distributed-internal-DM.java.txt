GEODE-3963: make DM.getCache thread safe

* made cache variables volatile for thread safety
* Added getExistingCache to DM which will throw an exception if cache
  does not exist or is closed.

+import org.apache.geode.cache.Cache;
+import org.apache.geode.cache.CacheClosedException;
+  /**
+   * The returned cache will be null if the cache does not yet exist. Note that the returned cache
+   * may be one that is already closed. Callers of GemFireCacheImpl.getInstance() should try to use
+   * this method.

+  /**
+   * Returns an existing non-closed cache associated with this DM. Callers of
+   * CacheFactory.getAnyInstance(), CacheFactory.getInstance(DistributedSystem) or
+   * GemFireCacheImpl.getExisting() should try to use this method.
+   *
+   * @throws CacheClosedException if a cache has not yet been associated with this DM or it has been
+   *         {@link Cache#isClosed closed}.
