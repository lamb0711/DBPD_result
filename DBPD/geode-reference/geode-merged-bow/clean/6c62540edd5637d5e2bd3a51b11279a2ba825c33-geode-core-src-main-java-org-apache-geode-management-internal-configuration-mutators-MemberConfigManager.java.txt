* Extensions and implementations of Execution and ResultCollector and the 
classes and interfaces involved in the execution chain were lacking the
ability to apply Generic types.
* Typing issues starting from MemberConfigManager.java class were fixed.
* Trivial IDE warnings were fixed.
-    Execution execution = FunctionService.onMembers(distributedMembers);
-    ResultCollector<?, ?> resultCollector = execution.execute(new GetMemberInformationFunction());
-    return (ArrayList<MemberInformation>) resultCollector.getResult();
+    Execution<DistributedMember, MemberInformation, ArrayList<MemberInformation>> execution =
+        FunctionService.onMembers(distributedMembers);
+    ResultCollector<MemberInformation, ArrayList<MemberInformation>> resultCollector =
+        execution.execute(new GetMemberInformationFunction());
+    return resultCollector.getResult();
