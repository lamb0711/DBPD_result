refactor locator creation to use interfaces.  Introduced NetMember interface for this purpose.  Added an initial unit test for the membership manager.  Changed logger initialization to ignore the log4j2.xml configuration file in the jgroups jar.

-  static Logger logger = Services.getLogger();
+  static Logger logger = GMSMemberServices.getLogger();
