GEODE-6380: Getting rid of nextOrindal pattern

We had some mutable statics that used a static nextOrdinal++ pattern.
This code worked, but it wasn't really necessary so removing the pattern
in favor of completely immutable static state.

-  public InterestResultPolicyImpl(String name) {
-    super(name);
+  public InterestResultPolicyImpl(String name, int ordinal) {
+    super(name, ordinal);
