GEODE-7808: standardize on use of HostAndPort to form client-side connections (#4743)

* Squashed merge of feature/GEODE-7808

removed HostAddress
renamed LocatorAddress to HostAndPort
modified TcpClient methods to take a HostAndPort argument instead of
InetAddress
modified SocketCreator to take a HostAndPort argument instead of
InetAddress

* GEODE-7808 - standardize on use of HostAndPort for connection formation

This continues a previous PR that passed and was approved for merge.
This commit raises up several methods from SocketCreator into the
TcpSocketCreator interface.  This is an intermediate commit.  A
subsequent commit will refactor TcpSocketCreator to separate the client
and server methods for creating server-sockets and client connections to
server-sockets.

* refactored socket-creators to separate concerns

ServerSocketCreator holds methods for non-client comms
ClientSocketCreator holds methods that clients should use for comms
AdvancedSocketCreator holds methods for people who need to get around
the limitations of the other two interfaces

* adding missing interface

* move code out of inner-classes into first-class classes

* renaming interfaces and methods to be less confusing
