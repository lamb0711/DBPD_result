GEODE-2730: Refactor ServerStarterRule and LocatorStarterRule

- Introduced LocalServerStarterRule and LocalLocatorStarterRule to eventually replace LocatorStarterRule and ServerStarterRule.
- The new rules will *only* start a member through the rule's before() method.  Members will *never* be started on Rule instantiation.
- The new rules are backed by Builders that use AvailablePort.Keeper to reserve the ports that a member will use when it eventually starts.  The Keepers are released just before starting the member, with the goal of minimizing test flakiness caused by BindExceptions when a port is already in use.

-        // partitionedregion = cache.createRegion(regionName, attr.create());
+        // partitionedregion = cache.withRegion(regionName, attr.create());
