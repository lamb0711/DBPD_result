GEODE-5078: provide API that does not allow access to internal regions (#1815)

The InternalCache interface now has a method named getCacheForProcessingClientRequests
that will return an InternalCache that throws a NotAuthorizedException if an attempt is made using
this cache to access or create an internal region.

+
+  /**
+   * Returns a version of InternalCache that can only access
+   * application visible regions. Any regions created internally
+   * by Geode will not be accessible from the returned cache.
+   */
+  InternalCache getCacheForProcessingClientRequests();
