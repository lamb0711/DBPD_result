GEODE-5686: Remove LocalizedStrings

Fixing problems found by lgtm.com

There were a lot of logging calls that were improperly converted from
(MessageFormatString, Argument, Exception) to a form that treated the
Exception as part of the String.format() call.

There were a number of errors in format strings or number of arguments.
MessageFormat was more forgiving about this than String.format().

There were a few dangling MessageFormat specs that needed to be
converted to String.format() specs.

This closes #2757

-          String.format("unable to parse integer:  %s", s), e);
+          String.format("unable to parse integer: %s", s), e);
-          String.format("Unable to parse float  %s", s));
+          String.format("Unable to parse float %s", s));
-          String.format("Unable to parse double  %s", s));
+          String.format("Unable to parse double %s", s));
-          String.format("Illegal format for DATE literal:  %s . Expected format is yyyy-mm-dd",
+          String.format("Illegal format for DATE literal: %s . Expected format is yyyy-mm-dd",
-          String.format("Illegal format for TIME literal:  %s . Expected format is hh:mm:ss",
+          String.format("Illegal format for TIME literal: %s . Expected format is hh:mm:ss",
-              "Illegal format for TIMESTAMP literal:  %s . Expected format is yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.fffffffff",
+              "Illegal format for TIMESTAMP literal: %s . Expected format is yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.fffffffff",
