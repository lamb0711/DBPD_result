GEODE-5783: have a single source for ThreadFactory

Use the keepalive parameter when initializing the thread factory.

I also made some logging changes while debugging the problems this
missing setting was causing.

-          logger.debug("Creating a durable HA queue");
+          logger.debug("Creating a {} subscription queue for {}",
+              createDurableQueue ? "durable" : "non-durable",
+              proxy.getProxyID());
