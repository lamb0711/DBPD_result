GEODE-11: Cleaning up old IndexRepositoryImpls when buckets move

When a bucket is moved, we leave the IndexRepositoryImpl open. But even
after the bucket moves back, we just dereference the old
IndexRepositoryImpl without closing it. We should make sure we always
invoke close on the IndexRepositoryImpl to clean up any resources the
IndexWriter is using.
