GEODE-4840: do not deserialize PdxInstances for remote gets (#1693)

The preferCD flag is now passed down to convertPdxInstanceIfNeeded.
if preferCD is true then the caller wants the serialized form back
from the load and in that case the PdxInstances bytes are wrapped
in a PreferBytesCachedDeserializable and it is returned.
So now the PdxInstance will only be deserialized if a local get is
done and pdx-read-serialized is false.

-  public Object convertPdxInstanceIfNeeded(Object obj) {
+  public Object convertPdxInstanceIfNeeded(Object obj, boolean preferCD) {
