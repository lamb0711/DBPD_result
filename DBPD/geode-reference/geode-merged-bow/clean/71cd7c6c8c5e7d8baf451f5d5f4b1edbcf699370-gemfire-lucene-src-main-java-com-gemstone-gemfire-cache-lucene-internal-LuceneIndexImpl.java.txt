Making lucene indexed fields their own XML element.

Rather than <lucene:index fields="x,y"> fields are now listed as their
own individual elements, for example

<lucene:index>
  <lucene:field name="x"/>
</lucene:index>

-    creation.setFieldNames(this.getFieldNames());
+    creation.addFieldNames(this.getFieldNames());
