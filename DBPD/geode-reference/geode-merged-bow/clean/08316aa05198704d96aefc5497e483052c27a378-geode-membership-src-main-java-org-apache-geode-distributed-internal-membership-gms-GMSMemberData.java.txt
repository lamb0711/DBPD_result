GEODE-8385: hang recovering from disk with cyclic dependencies (#5403)

* GEODE-8385: hang recovering from disk with cyclic dependencies

This restores the point at which we notify membership listeners of
departures.  We used to do this (in 1.12 and earlier) when a ShutdownMessage
is received instead of waiting for a new membership view announcing the departure.
Membership views can take some time to form and install, which can cause
persistent (disk store) views to be updated later than they used to be.

In the case of this ticket the disk store of one member was being
closed while another was shutting down.  The member closing its disk
store did not see the view announcing that shutdown until most of its
disk store regions had closed their persistence advisors.  This left the
disk store thinking that the other member was still up at the time it
was closed.
