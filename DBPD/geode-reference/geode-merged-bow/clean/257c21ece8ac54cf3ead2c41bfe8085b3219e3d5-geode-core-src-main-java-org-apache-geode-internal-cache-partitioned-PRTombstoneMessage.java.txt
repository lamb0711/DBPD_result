GEODE-2489: Avoid sending tombstone GC messages to peer nodes if there is no client registration

When tombstones are removed, tombstone messages are sent to region replicas; and in case of Partitioned Region (PR) messages are also sent to peer region nodes for client events.

Currently tombstone messages meant for clients that have all the keys removed are getting sent to peer PR nodes even though no clients are registered on those peers.

+        r.getPartitionedRegion().getRegionAdvisor().adviseAllServersWithInterest();
