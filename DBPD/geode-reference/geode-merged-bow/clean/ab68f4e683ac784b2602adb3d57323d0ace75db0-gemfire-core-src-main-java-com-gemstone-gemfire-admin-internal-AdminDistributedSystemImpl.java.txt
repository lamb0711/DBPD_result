GEODE-77 fixing the inability to create multiple MembershipManagers ina single JVM

The static MemberAttributes.DEFAULT was being used to pull together all
of the bits of a new members identity (InternalDistributedMember) but
this prevented multiple MembershipManagers from being instantiated w/o
ones identity bleeding into anothers.  Now the MembershipManager is the
assembling a single InternalDistributedMember instance, putting info
into it as it becomes available.  A new unit test ensures that this is
functioning correctly.
