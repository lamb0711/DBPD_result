install the messenger's JGAddress into the JGroups stack so it will be transmitted with messages.  Add conversion from JGAddress to GMSMember and InternalDistributedMember for setting the sender of a message.  This shortens the length of JGroups messages by removing the GMSMember that was being serialized at the beginning of every message.

+import java.util.Set;

-  InternalDistributedMember getMemberID(NetMember m);
+  Set<InternalDistributedMember> send(DistributionMessage m) throws NotSerializableException;
