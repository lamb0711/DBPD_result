GEODE-5515: Only initTXMemberId in PartitionMessage if transaction is originated from client. (#2242)

  * Only initTXMemberId in PartitionMessage if transaction is originated from client.

  * Returns client member id in TXState.getOriginatingMember() if it is a client originated transaction
    so it can be correctly set in the PartitionMessage.

-    /*
-     * State will never fwd on to other nodes so this is not relevant
-     */
-    return null;
+    // During set operations we need to forward it to other nodes to avoid
+    // wrong transaction is masqueraded if the transaction is on behalf of a client.
+    // This needs to be set to the clients member id if the client originated the tx.
+    return proxy.getOnBehalfOfClientMember();
