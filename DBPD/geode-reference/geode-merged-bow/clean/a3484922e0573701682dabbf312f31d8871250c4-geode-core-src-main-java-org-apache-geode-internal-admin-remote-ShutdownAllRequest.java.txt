GEODE-3557: remove calls to GemFireCacheImpl getInstance

The DM now remembers the InternalCache that created it.
Changed places that had a dm to use its getCache method
instead of GemFireCacheImpl getInstance.

-        GemFireCacheImpl.getInstance().shutDownAll();
+        dm.getCache().shutDownAll();
