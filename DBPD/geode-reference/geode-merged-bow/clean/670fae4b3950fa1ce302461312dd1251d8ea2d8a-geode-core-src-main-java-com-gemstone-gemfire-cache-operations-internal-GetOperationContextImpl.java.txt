GEODE-1463: Legacy OperationContexts do not set the appropriate Shiro
permission tuple

- Moved ResourceOperationContext into a 'public' package.
- Converted OperationContext into an interface.
- Cleaned up the hierarchy of everything that previously
  extended OperationContext.
- Marked GetOperationContext as abstract seeing that
  GetOperationContextImpl extends it and there are no uses of
  GetOperationContext anywhere. (So why does it still exist?).

-  
+
+  /**
+   * Constructor for a concrete {@link GetOperationContext}
+   *
+   * @param key           the key object
+   * @param postOperation boolean indication whether this is a post-operation
+   */
-    super(key, postOperation);
+    super(OperationCode.GET, key, postOperation);
