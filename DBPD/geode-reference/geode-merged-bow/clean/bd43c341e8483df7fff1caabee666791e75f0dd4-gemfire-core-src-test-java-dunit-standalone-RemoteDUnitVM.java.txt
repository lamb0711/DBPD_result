new unit tests and code clean-up

New unit tests to increase code coverage.  I also tinkered with
trying to get EclEmma output from DUnit ChildVMs but it seems to
be run in a shutdownHook in parallel with the DUnitLauncher
shutdownHook.

-  public void shutDownVM(boolean disconnect, boolean runShutdownHook)
-      throws RemoteException {
+  public void shutDownVM() throws RemoteException {
+    ChildVM.stopVM();
-  public void disconnectVM()
-  throws RemoteException {
+  public void disconnectVM() throws RemoteException {
