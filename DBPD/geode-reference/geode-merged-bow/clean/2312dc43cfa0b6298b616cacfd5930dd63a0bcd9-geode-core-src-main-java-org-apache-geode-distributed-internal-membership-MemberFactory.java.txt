GEODE-6883: Removing no longer needed fields from Services

We no longer need these fields in Services, because they were only used
by GMSAuthenticator. Now we no longer need to inject a DistributedSystem
or a SecurityService into the MembersihpManager.

-    return services.newMembershipManager(listener, system, transport, stats, securityService,
-        authenticator);
+    return services.newMembershipManager(listener, transport, stats,
+        authenticator, system.getConfig());
