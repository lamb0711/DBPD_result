GEODE-8338: change redis commands not be repeated when a server dies (#5351)

The redis functions are no longer HA.
The product does have some cases when it can safely retry the function
but if a server dies the client will see a redis error containing "memberDeparted".
In that case the client app can check to see if the redis operation should be done
again, or if it already happened even though a server died.
