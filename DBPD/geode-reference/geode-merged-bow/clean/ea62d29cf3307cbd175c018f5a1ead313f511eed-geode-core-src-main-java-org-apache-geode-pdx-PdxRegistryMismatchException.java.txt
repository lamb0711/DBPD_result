GEODE-6177: WAN Event processing continues after authentication fails

Due to different handling in the GatewaySenderEventRemoteDispatcher
dispatcher and ack reader threads, it was possible for event processing
to stop when a GemFireSecurityException was encountered by the ack
reader connection retry logic.

This commit attempts to share common recoverable cases between the ack
reader and dispatcher, while maintaining the cases which are specific to
each.  We also added a test which ensures that if a connection is denied
due to invalid credentials upon a restart of the receiver, that the
sender can recover if it again provides valid credentials.  In the process,
we removed a significant amount of duplicated and noisy code in the
NewWanAuthenticationDUnitTests.
