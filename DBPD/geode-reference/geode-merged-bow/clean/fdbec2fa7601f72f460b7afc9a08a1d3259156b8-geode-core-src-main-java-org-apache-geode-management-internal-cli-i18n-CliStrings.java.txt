GEODE-5353: gfsh hint should be case independent

- Added integration tests for `gfsh hint` command.
- Removed some minor warnings from the `Helper` class.
- Replaced the internal `HashMap` containing the `topics` for a
  `TreeMap` with the `String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER` comparator.

-      "Unknown topic: {0}. Use " + HINT + "; to view the list of available topics.";
+      "Unknown topic: {0}. Use " + HINT + " to view the list of available topics.";
