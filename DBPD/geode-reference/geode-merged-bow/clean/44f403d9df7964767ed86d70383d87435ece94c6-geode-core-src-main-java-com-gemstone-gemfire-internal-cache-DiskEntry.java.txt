GEODE-1304: remove TODO OFFHEAP comments

Tickets have been filed with the information from the removed comments.

This checkin does change LocalRegion validatedCreate/Put/Destroy
to no longer do an offheap release; instead the calling method does.

-      // TODO OFFHEAP: No need to retain since we hold the sync on entry but we need a flavor of _getValue that will decompress
