GEODE-3787: Do not catch NotAuthorizedExceptions in CompiledIteratorDef

  * Fixed test where fail was not being called when needed
  * Queries that do not actually invoke a method but should be restricted
    are now reclassified into a new dunit test

+import org.apache.geode.security.NotAuthorizedException;
+      } catch (NotAuthorizedException e) {
+        throw e;
