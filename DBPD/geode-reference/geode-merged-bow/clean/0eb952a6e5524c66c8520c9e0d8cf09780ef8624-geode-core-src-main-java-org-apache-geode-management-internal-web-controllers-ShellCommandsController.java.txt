GEODE-1984: Fix Issue Make GatewaySender destroy a public API

    1. Making destory API public
    2. Added a new gfsh WAN command destroyGatewaySender
    3. Impleted GatewaySenderDestroyFunction, which first stop gatewaysender
       and then call destroy on the same.
    4. Added a WAN Rest Controller for destroy gatewaysender
    5. Removed the need of explicit casting of sender to AbstractGatewaySender for calling
       destroy API
    6. Renamed Test WanCommandCreateGatewaySenderDUnitTest to WanCommandCreateDestroyGatewaySenderDUnitTest
    7. Each applicable test now also calls destroy gfsh command and verfies the result
    8. Minor changes in the logging for each tests

+        .add(new Link(CliStrings.DESTROY_GATEWAYSENDER, toUri("/gateways/senders/{id}", scheme),
+            HttpMethod.DELETE))
