GEODE-7866: Clean up geode-tcp-server module and add missing javadocs (#4791)

* GEODE-7866: Clean up geode-tcp-server module and add missing javadocs

Added package-info javadoc

Renamed ServerSocketCreatorImpl to ClusterSocketCreatorImpl and renamed
variables associated with these objects

Removed TcpServerGossipVersionDUnitTest, which was only needed in old
pre-Geode code when transitioning from GemFire 6x to GemFire 7x.

Added javadocs to classes and public methods.

Changed TcpServerProductVersionDUnitTest to use a TcpServer instead of a
Locator.  Modified the test to wait for the TcpServer to shut down after
it receives a ShutdownMessage.

* fixed error in InternalLocator.stop() that left a singleton Locator in place

* fixing unit test failure - test creates a locator with no DS
- * This class is serializable for testing. A number of client/server and WAN tests
+ * HostAndPort is a holder of a host name/address and a port. It is the primary
+ * way to specify a connection endpoint in the socket-creator methods.
+ * <p>
+ * Note: This class is serializable for testing. A number of client/server and WAN tests
+ *

+ * @see TcpClient
-   * If location is not litteral IP address a new resolved {@link InetSocketAddress} is returned.
-   *
-   * @return resolved {@link InetSocketAddress}, otherwise stored {@link InetSocketAddress} if
-   *         literal IP address is used.
+   * Returns an InetSocketAddress for this host and port. An attempt is made to resolve the
+   * host name but if resolution fails an unresolved InetSocketAddress is returned. This return
+   * value will not hold an InetAddress, so calling getAddress() on it will return null.
