GEODE-7369: Deprecate SystemFailure Class (#4253)


+ *
+ *
+ * @deprecated since Geode 1.11 because it is potentially counterproductive to try
+ *             to mitigate a VirtualMachineError since the JVM (spec) makes no guarantees about the
+ *             soundness of the JVM after such an error. In the presence of a VirtualMachineError,
+ *             the simplest solution is really the only solution: exit the JVM as soon as possible.
