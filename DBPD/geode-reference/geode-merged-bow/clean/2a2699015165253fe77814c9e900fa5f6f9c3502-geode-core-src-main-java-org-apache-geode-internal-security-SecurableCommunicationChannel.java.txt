GEODE-5830: Remove "none" from SSL configuration

The 'NONE' enum constant doesn't work and it's not used, so it's
entirely removed by this commit. Updated documentation and tests.

-  LOCATOR(SecurableCommunicationChannels.LOCATOR),
-  NONE("none");
+  LOCATOR(SecurableCommunicationChannels.LOCATOR);
