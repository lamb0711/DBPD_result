-- reviewed all EntryEventImpl creators
-- created two new subclasses to mark ones that are never off-heap
-- added annotations and comments on all creators
-- added missing release calls

+import com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.offheap.annotations.Released;
-          EntryEventImpl ev = PutAllPRMessage.getEventFromEntry(theRegion,
+          @Released EntryEventImpl ev = PutAllPRMessage.getEventFromEntry(theRegion,
-          EntryEventImpl ev = RemoveAllPRMessage.getEventFromEntry(theRegion,
+          @Released EntryEventImpl ev = RemoveAllPRMessage.getEventFromEntry(theRegion,
+          try {
+          } finally {
+            ev.release();
+          }
