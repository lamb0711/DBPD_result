GEODE-7186: Move HttpService implementation into its own module (#4040)

- For maven/gradle consumption, this component becomes an optional
  dependency.
- The CacheService.init() method now returns a boolean indicating
  whether the given service was initialized or not.
- Services are now created before cache creation resourcce events are
  emitted.
-  public void init(Cache cache) {
+  public boolean init(Cache cache) {
+
+    return true;
