GEODE-4541: remove singleton calls (#1463)

* removed getAnyInstance call from PartitionedRegionHelper

* removed getInstance call from CacheServerLauncher

* removed getAnyInstance call from EventStateHelper

* DistributedPutAllOperation no longer calls GemFireCacheImpl.getInstance

* EntryEventImpl no longer calls getInstance.
This fix requires that when an EntryEventImpl is deserialized
that setRegion will be called on it before the values are accessed.
Also encapsulated the "region" field and got rid of getLocalRegion
in favor of getRegion.

-      InternalRegion r = event.getLocalRegion();
+      InternalRegion r = event.getRegion();
