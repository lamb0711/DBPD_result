GEODE-1494: Changing stats list to be a CopyOnWriteArrayList

The statsList used to track Statistics in InternalDistributedSystem was
managed under a lock. That was problematic, because code that iterates
on the list needs to hold the lock. If the code invoking callbacks for
GEODE-1494 was slow, that means the lock would block other stats
operations.

Changing this list to a copy on write array list to holding a lock for a
long period of time.

-    synchronized (statsList) {
-      for (Statistics s : statsList) {
-        if (stopRequested()) return;
-        if (s instanceof StatisticsImpl) {
-          ((StatisticsImpl)s).prepareForSample();
-        }
+    for (Statistics s : statsList) {
+      if (stopRequested()) return;
+      if (s instanceof StatisticsImpl) {
+        ((StatisticsImpl)s).prepareForSample();
