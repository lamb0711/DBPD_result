* System property geode.defaultDiskDirs is used to specify some dir
  other than "."
* DiskDirRule can be used by IntegrationTests
* DistributedDiskDirRule can be used by DistributedTests
* Update BucketRegionSizeWithOverflowRegressionTest to use
  DistributedDiskDirRule
- * this class extends the capability of JUnit's ExternalResource in that it provides a Description
- * object in the before and after methods, so that the implementation would have access to the
- * annotation of the test methods
+ * A base class for Rules that require {@code Description} to set up an external resource before
+ * a test and tear it down afterward. {@code DescribedExternalResource} is similar to
+ * {@code ExternalResource} but includes {@code Description} as a parameter to both {@code before}
+ * and {@code after}.
+ *
+ * <p>
+ * {@code Description} allows the implementation to have access to the test class, its annotations
+ * and information about JUnit lifecycle.
