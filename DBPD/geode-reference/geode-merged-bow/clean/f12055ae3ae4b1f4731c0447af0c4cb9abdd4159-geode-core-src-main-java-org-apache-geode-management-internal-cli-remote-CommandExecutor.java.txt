* refactor AlterRegionCommand to use ResultModel and RegionConfig
* only alter region in the same group as the region is created on
* when cluster configuration is enabled, if region does not exist in CC, the command would error out.
* The command would no longer alter region not created by gfsh command
* add more unit tests

-        (InternalConfigurationPersistenceService) gfshCommand.getConfigurationPersistenceService();
+        gfshCommand.getConfigurationPersistenceService();
-          String message = "failed to update cluster config for " + group;
+          String message = "Failed to update cluster config for " + group;
