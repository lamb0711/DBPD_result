GEODE-1372 Removed un used field from GMSMember while sending message.

These fields were extra which doesn't require with each messsage.
Now we get sender id from prepared view if we don't find in current
view. Did some other cleanup. Added test for it

+import com.gemstone.gemfire.distributed.internal.membership.NetMember;
+import com.gemstone.gemfire.distributed.internal.membership.gms.GMSMember;
+   * Get "InternalDistributedMember" from current view or prepared view.

+  InternalDistributedMember getMemberID(NetMember m);
