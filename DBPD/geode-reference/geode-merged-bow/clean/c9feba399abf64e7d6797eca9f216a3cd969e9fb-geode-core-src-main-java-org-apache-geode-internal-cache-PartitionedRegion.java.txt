GEODE-4299: refactor eviction

The EvictionController classes are no longer Serializable nor Cloneable. These internal classes used to be external and needed to be these things in the past because they were stored in the configuration. But they no longer are so these interfaces were removed for clarity.
The EvictionController classes are no longer responsible for creating InternalEvictionStatistics. Instead the other entities it depends on are passed in to its constructor.

The only class with an EvictionController instance is now VMLRURegionMap which makes the code easier to understand and reduces the number of inter-module dependencies.

renamed internalSetMaximum to setMaximum on EvictionAttributesImpl

AbstractBucketRegionQueue no longer uses EvictionStatistics to notify itself that it removed some objects from the queue. So it no longer needs to access all the EvictionStatistics.

AbstractLRURegionMap has been moved to VMLRURegionMap
Casts to AbstractLRURegionMap have been removed by added additional methods to RegionMap.

new EvictableRegion interface make clear the things a region implementation needs to do/provide for the eviction implementation

EvictionAttributesMutator is now implemented by the dedicated class EvictionAttributesMutatorImpl

close and clear on RegionMap now take a BucketRegion parameter so that the eviction classes do not need to keep track of the BucketRegion.

EvictionList no longer does some of the things it did before that should have been the responsibility of the EvictionController. Now the EvictionList is given the EvictionController it should defer to. The EvictionListBuilder has been simplified since EvictionList now only needs a controller.

The eviction classes that track statistics have been refactored to be clearer. Now the EvictionStats interface is implemented by classes that provide vsd type stats. The EvictionCounters interface is implemented by a class that wraps EvictionStats and provides atomics for some of them.* Removed old code that made the EvictionController classes
Serializable, Declarable, and Clonable.
