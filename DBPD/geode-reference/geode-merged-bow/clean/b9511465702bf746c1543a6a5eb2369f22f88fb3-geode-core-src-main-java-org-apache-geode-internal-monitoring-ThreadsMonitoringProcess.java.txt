GEODE-5142 new Thread Monitoring Mechanism

Fixing some formatting problems in stack trace output and other log
messages.  One person noticed the monitor saying it was "expiring"
a thread and thought it was doing something other than print stack
traces.

-      logger.trace("Checking Thread {}\n", entry1.getKey());
+      logger.trace("Checking thread {}", entry1.getKey());
-        logger.warn("Thread <{}> is stuck , initiating handleExpiry\n", entry1.getKey());
+        logger.warn("Thread <{}> is stuck", entry1.getKey());
-      logger.trace("There are NO stuck threads in the system\n");
+      logger.trace("There are no stuck threads in the system\n");
-      logger.warn("There are <{}> stuck threads in the system\n", numOfStuck);
+      logger.warn("There are <{}> stuck threads in thia node", numOfStuck);
