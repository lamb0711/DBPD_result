GEODE-3557: remove calls to GemFireCacheImpl getInstance

The DM now remembers the InternalCache that created it.
Changed places that had a dm to use its getCache method
instead of GemFireCacheImpl getInstance.

-    GemFireCacheImpl cache = GemFireCacheImpl.getInstance();
+    InternalCache cache = dm.getCache();
