- * A Filesystem like interface that stores file data in gemfire regions.
+ * A Filesystem like interface that stores file data in geode regions.
+ *
+  /**
+   * Create filesystem that will store data in the two provided regions. The fileRegion contains
+   * metadata about the files, and the chunkRegion contains the actual data. If data from either region is missing
+   * or inconsistent, no guarantees are made about what this class will do, so it's best if these regions are colocated
+   * and in the same disk store to ensure the data remains together.
+   * @param fileRegion the region to store metadata about the files
+   * @param chunkRegion the region to store actual file data.
