GEODE-5985 Possible integer overflow

We had a number of calculations that were taking place with ints instead
of longs.  I've modified them to, in most places, just add an L to the
constant multiplier.  In other places I had to change a variable type
from int to long.

There were a few places that were also assigning a long to an int
variable or an int to a byte variable.  In these I added bit AND
operators to reduce the chances of overflow.

IndexElemArray needed a lot of work due to its "size" instvar being
a byte.

This closes #2783

-          boolean start = checker.checkForQuorum(3 * this.myDs.getConfig().getMemberTimeout());
+          boolean start = checker.checkForQuorum(3L * this.myDs.getConfig().getMemberTimeout());
-              giveup = System.currentTimeMillis() + locatorWaitTime * 1000;
+              giveup = System.currentTimeMillis() + locatorWaitTime * 1000L;
