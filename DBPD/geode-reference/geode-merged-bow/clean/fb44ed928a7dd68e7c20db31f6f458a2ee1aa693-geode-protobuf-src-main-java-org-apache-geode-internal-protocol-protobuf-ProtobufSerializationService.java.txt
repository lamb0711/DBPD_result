GEODE-3710 Make CodecAlreadyRegisteredForTypeException a RuntimeException.

If we throw this exception, the `SerializationCodecRegistry` will
already be in an invalid state, so it doesn't make sense for anyone to
catch it.

* privatize `SerializationCodecRegistry.register()`.
* Throw a `GemFireConfigException` when a
  `CodecAlreadyRegisteredForTypeException` is thrown, because it is a
  fatal error that will halt client messaging.
* remove most of `CodecRegistryJUnitTest`.
  This test was mostly testing that `PowerMockito` could create enum
  variants that didn't exist.
