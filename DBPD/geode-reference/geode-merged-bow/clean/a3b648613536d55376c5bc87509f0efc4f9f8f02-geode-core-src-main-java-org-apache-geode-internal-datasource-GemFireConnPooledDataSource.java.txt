Addressing minor issues in javadocs and code reported by LooksGoodToMe.

One change that I made wasn't reported by that tool: I removed

This closes #2780

-   * Creates a new instance of GemFireConnPooledDataSource
-   *
-   * @param connPoolDS The ConnectionPoolDataSource object for the database driver.
-   * @param configs The ConfiguredDataSourceProperties containing the datasource properties.
-   */
