GEODE-5109: Overriding the missing profile check for Lucene (#1922)

        * A new createRegionMessage created for Lucene reindex validation
	* The check method is overridden to ignore missing profile check in case of reindex.
	* A member may be missing a reindex operation because it is waiting for the index command, but this should not prevent another member from creating a Lucene index via reindex
	* Backwards compatible because this message will not be sent to members older than 1.7
+  short CREATE_REGION_MESSAGE_LUCENE = -159;
