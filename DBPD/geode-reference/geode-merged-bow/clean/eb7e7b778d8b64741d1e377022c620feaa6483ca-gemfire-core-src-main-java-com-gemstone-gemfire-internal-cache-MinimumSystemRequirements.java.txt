GEODE-214: improve Azul support

- isTenured now looks for "GenPauseless Old Gen" for azul.
- Azul jvm version no longer logged as unsupported.
- Fatal log message about jvm version not being supported
  is now a warning since we continue to run.
- Fixed a bug in ReflectionSingleObjectSizer in how it calculated
  the size of a field. It was calling Field.getClass instead of Field.getType.
  Field.getClass always returns an instance of Field.class which the sizer
  always says is an objref size. getType will return a primitive class
  for primitive fields which is what we want.
- Improved ObjectSizerJUnitTest.
- The object header size and reference size are now correctly computed
  for azul.
- Added some java 8 support to the ObjectSizer.
- Fix tests that are unintentionally spawning processes that use the
  default mcast-port. This fixes intermittent failures caused by finding
  another member of the wrong GemFire version.

-      logger.fatal(LocalizedMessage.create(LocalizedStrings.MinimumSystemRequirements_NOT_MET));
+      logger.warn(LocalizedMessage.create(LocalizedStrings.MinimumSystemRequirements_NOT_MET));
-    logger.fatal(LocalizedMessage.create(LocalizedStrings.MinimumSystemRequirements_JAVA_VERSION, JAVA_VERSION));
+    logger.warn(LocalizedMessage.create(LocalizedStrings.MinimumSystemRequirements_JAVA_VERSION, JAVA_VERSION));
