GEODE-2367: Lucene indexes do not handle ha scenarios

* Added afterSecondary callback to partition listener to allow cleaning up
  of the index repo when the bucket losses primary
* Added lock prior to creating the bucket indexes to prevent multiple index
  writers from being available at a time
* Changed single point of lucene index creation, no longer creating on the fly

+   * Callback invoked when any bucket in a partitioned region stops being primary
+   *
+   * @param bucketId id of the bucket which stopped being primary
+   * @since Geode 1.1
+   */
+  default public void afterSecondary(int bucketId) {
