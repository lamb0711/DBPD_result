GEODE-5043: Buffering protobuf output to avoid multiple packet sends (#1768)

GEODE-5043: Buffering protobuf output to avoid multiple packet sends

Based on the stats all protobuf requests and responses were being sent
as two packets. Using a BufferedOutputStream to make sure we only send 1
packet

-
-      initStreams(socket, socketBufferSize, stats);
+      theSocket = socket;
+      theSocket.setSendBufferSize(socketBufferSize);
+      theSocket.setReceiveBufferSize(socketBufferSize);
-
-  private void initStreams(Socket s, int socketBufferSize, MessageStats msgStats) {
+  protected void initStreams(Socket s, int socketBufferSize, MessageStats msgStats) {
-      theSocket = s;
-      theSocket.setSendBufferSize(socketBufferSize);
-      theSocket.setReceiveBufferSize(socketBufferSize);
