GEODE-5027 Bump version to 1.6.0 and add v1.5.0 for testing

* I bumped the version in Version.java to 1.6.0 and added a 1.6 command set
  to CommandInitializer.
* I added v1.5.0 to geode-old-versions for backward compatibility testing.

* I removed junk in Version.java that hasn't been used since the SQLFire/GFX
  days.
* I also removed AcceptorImpl.VERSION which seemed to serve no good purpose.

* I added a unit test to make sure that folks update the CommandInitializer
  table when adding a new Version.  Without this test folks would have to run
  distributedTests to notice any problems with their changes.

* I changed CommandInitializer to not create new maps unless necessary.

* I fixed a test's expectation that the default connection pool exists after starting
  a client cache.  Starting with 1.5 the pool isn't created until it's needed.

This closes #1753
