GEODE-6423 availability checks sometimes immediately initiate removal

Ensure that the availability check is performed for the contracted
member-timeout period.  This allows a suspect to survive the check if
it's having a momentary glitch like a brief garbage-collection, or if
there is short network outage.

This change caused some "reconnect" tests to fail due to short
auto-reconnect intervals letting disconnected nodes start reconnecting
before suspect processing completed on the force-disconnected nodes.
I've fixed this by reinitializing the UUID part of the membership ID in
JGroupsMessenger during reconnect attempts.
