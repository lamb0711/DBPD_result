GEODE-1238: fix EntryEventImpl already released

DistributedPut/RemoveAllOperation now have getEventForPosition
as @Unretained. The callers of this method no longer release
since the operation will release these events already at the end
of its life.

-      @Released EntryEventImpl event = (EntryEventImpl)it.next();
-      try {
+      @Unretained EntryEventImpl event = (EntryEventImpl)it.next();
-      } finally {
-        event.release();
-      }
-      @Released EntryEventImpl event = (EntryEventImpl)it.next();
-      try {
+      @Unretained EntryEventImpl event = (EntryEventImpl)it.next();
-      } finally {
-        event.release();
-      }
