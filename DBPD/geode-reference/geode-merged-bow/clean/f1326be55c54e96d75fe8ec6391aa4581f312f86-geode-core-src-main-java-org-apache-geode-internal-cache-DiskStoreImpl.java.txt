GEODE-2654: Backups can capture different members from different points in time
Online backup now takes a backup from a single point in time.
This is done by making all write operations get a backup lock which causes them to
wait until the oplogs are rolled by backup.

+  /**
+   * Lock used to synchronize access to the init file. This is a lock rather than a synchronized
+   * block because the backup tool needs to acquire this lock.
+   */
+  private final BackupLock backupLock = new BackupLock();
+
+  public BackupLock getBackupLock() {
+    return backupLock;
+  }
+
-    getDiskInitFile().lockForBackup();
+    getBackupLock().lockForBackup();
-    getDiskInitFile().unlockForBackup();
+    getBackupLock().unlockForBackup();
-    getDiskInitFile().setBackupThread(Thread.currentThread());
+    getBackupLock().setBackupThread();
