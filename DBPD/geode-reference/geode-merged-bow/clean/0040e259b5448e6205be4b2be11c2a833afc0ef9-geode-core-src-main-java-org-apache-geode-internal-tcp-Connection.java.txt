GEODE-3583: Marking static variables final that are never modified

To help reduce the number of mutable statics to look through, adding
final to all of the statics that are not actually mutated outside of a
static initializer.

This change *only* consists of adding final to these variables.

-  private static AtomicLong idCounter = new AtomicLong(1);
+  private static final AtomicLong idCounter = new AtomicLong(1);
-  private static ThreadLocal<Integer> dominoCount = new ThreadLocal<Integer>() {
+  private static final ThreadLocal<Integer> dominoCount = new ThreadLocal<Integer>() {
-  private static ByteBuffer okHandshakeBuf;
+  private static final ByteBuffer okHandshakeBuf;
