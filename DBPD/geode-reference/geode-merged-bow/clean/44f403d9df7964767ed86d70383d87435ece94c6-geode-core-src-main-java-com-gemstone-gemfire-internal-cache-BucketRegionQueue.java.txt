GEODE-1304: remove TODO OFFHEAP comments

Tickets have been filed with the information from the removed comments.

This checkin does change LocalRegion validatedCreate/Put/Destroy
to no longer do an offheap release; instead the calling method does.

-    // To support this callers need to call freeOffHeapResources on the returned GatewaySenderEventImpl.
+    // To support this callers need to call release on the returned GatewaySenderEventImpl.
-//     return object; // TODO OFFHEAP: see what callers do with the returned GatewaySenderEventImpl. We need to inc its refcount before we do the destroyKey.
+//     return object;
