Removing TCPConduit's Stub ID class

This removes the Stub identifier class from TCPConduit.  This simplifies the
code since the DistributedMember IDs are propagated to all of the methods
that require identifiers and these IDs have all of the information Stubs
had.

The MembershipManager is also simplified since it doesn't have to keep
complicated mappings between Stubs and DistributedMembers.
