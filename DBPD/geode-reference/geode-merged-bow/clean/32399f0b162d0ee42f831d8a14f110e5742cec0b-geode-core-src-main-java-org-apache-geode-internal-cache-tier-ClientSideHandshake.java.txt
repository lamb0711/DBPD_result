GEODE-5955 CacheClientUpdater statistics are created and never closed on failed initialization

Close statistics if construction of a CacheClientUpdater fails.

I had to introduce a StatisticsProvider in order to inject a mock
statistics object into the CacheClientUpdater.  I also reworked the
"finally" block in the constructor to use the updater's close()
method.

+    return getMembershipId().isDurable();
