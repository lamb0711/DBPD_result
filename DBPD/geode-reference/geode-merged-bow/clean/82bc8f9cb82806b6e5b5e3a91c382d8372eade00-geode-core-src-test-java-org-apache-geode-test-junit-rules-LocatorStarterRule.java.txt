GEODE-5284: Add testing surrounding MBean persistence during member failure and reconnection. (#2066)

* Add null-check to ConfigurationChangeListener to avoid NPE when a locator joins.
* Add withPort method to MemberStarterRule to specify membership port
* Add testing associated with MemberStarterRule addition
* Ensure cleanup of members in MemberStarterRuleIntegrationTest.
* Improve names and extract helper methods
* use the methods provided by the starter rules to force disconnect and
to reconnect servers and locators. Adds a parameter in InternalLocator
to track the status of the reconnect. Adds export of cache xml for
reconnect so that the server is able to restore its state following
disconnect.

-      locator = (InternalLocator) startLocatorAndDS(0, null, properties);
+      locator = (InternalLocator) startLocatorAndDS(memberPort, null, properties);
+    // memberPort is by default zero, which translates to "randomly select an available port,"
+    // which is why it is updated here after being specified above.
