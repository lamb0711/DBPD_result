GEODE-5686: Remove LocalizedStrings

Fixing problems found by lgtm.com

There were a lot of logging calls that were improperly converted from
(MessageFormatString, Argument, Exception) to a form that treated the
Exception as part of the String.format() call.

There were a number of errors in format strings or number of arguments.
MessageFormat was more forgiving about this than String.format().

There were a few dangling MessageFormat specs that needed to be
converted to String.format() specs.

This closes #2757

-      logger.fatal(String.format("Uncaught exception processing  %s", this), t);
+      logger.fatal(String.format("Uncaught exception processing %s", this), t);
-          logger.warn(String.format("%s  schedule() rejected", this.toString()), ex);
+          logger.warn(String.format("%s schedule() rejected", this.toString()), ex);
-        logger.fatal(String.format("Uncaught exception processing  %s", this), t);
+        logger.fatal(String.format("Uncaught exception processing %s", this), t);
