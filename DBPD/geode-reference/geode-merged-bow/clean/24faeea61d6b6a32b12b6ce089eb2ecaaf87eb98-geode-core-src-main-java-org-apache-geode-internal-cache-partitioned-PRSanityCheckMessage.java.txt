GEODE-7196 Simplify ClusterDistributionManage

remove distribution ID collections from ClusterDistributionManager

move Executors out of DistributionManager implementations

make membership views immutable - we shouldn't install a new view
and then modify it because it's now used directly by other code.

+import org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.OperationExecutors;
-    return ClusterDistributionManager.HIGH_PRIORITY_EXECUTOR;
+    return OperationExecutors.HIGH_PRIORITY_EXECUTOR;
