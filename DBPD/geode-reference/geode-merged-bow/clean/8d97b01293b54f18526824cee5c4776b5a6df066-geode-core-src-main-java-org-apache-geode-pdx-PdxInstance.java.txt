GEODE-6290: change PdxInstance.equals for empty class name (#3091)

PdxInstance.equals will only act as if an instance has a field
with the default value if the class name is not empty.
If the class name is empty it will now require that both instances
have all the same identity fields.
If the class name is empty then neverDeserialize will be called automatically.

+   * An empty string will be returned if no class is associated with this instance.
-   * If one of the instances does not have a field that the other one does then equals will assume
-   * it has the field with a default value. If a PdxInstance has marked identity fields using
+   * If the domain class is not the empty string then
+   * if one of the instances does not have a field that the other one does
+   * then equals will assume it has the field with a default value.
+   * If a PdxInstance has marked identity fields using
-   * {@link PdxInstanceFactory#neverDeserialize}.
+   * {@link PdxInstanceFactory#neverDeserialize} or by creating a factory with
+   * an empty string as the class name.
