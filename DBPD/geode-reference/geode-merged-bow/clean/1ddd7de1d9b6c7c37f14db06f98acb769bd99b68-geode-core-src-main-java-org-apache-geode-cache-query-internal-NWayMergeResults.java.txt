GEODE-7957: query results toData will write to correct output stream  (#4922)

  
  * Previously, when a query is executed in a function, the toData on specific results
    set types would write directly to the wrong output stream, causing deserialization issues
-        DataSerializer.writeObjectArray(fields, out);
+        DataSerializer.writeObjectArray(fields, hdos);
