GEODE-1745: Fixed the comparison during query re-evaluation using CompactMapRangeIndexes

	* Initially the object to be searched was compared with the tuple returned by the Compact Range Index which contains the object to be searched and a key
	* This led to mismatch to occur resulting in false query results.
	* Fixed to compare with the first element of the tuple returned by the compact range index.

+      if(null != right  && indexInfo._getIndex() instanceof CompactMapRangeIndex){
+        right = ((Object[])right)[0];
+      }
