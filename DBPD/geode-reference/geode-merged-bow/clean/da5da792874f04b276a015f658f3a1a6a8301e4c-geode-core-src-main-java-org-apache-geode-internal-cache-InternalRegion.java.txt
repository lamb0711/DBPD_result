GEODE-4651: fix transactional destroy entry leak (#1433)

When the transaction marks a region entry as no
longer being used by the transaction, it no longer
added it back to the eviction list if the entry
is removed or destroyed.
+  /**
+   * Used by unit tests to get access to the EntryExpiryTask of the given key. Returns null if the
+   * entry exists but does not have an expiry task.
+   *
+   * @throws EntryNotFoundException if no entry exists key.
+   */
+  EntryExpiryTask getEntryExpiryTask(Object key);
