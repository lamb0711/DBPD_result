GEODE-77: initiation of member verification on loss of shared/ordered connection

The initiation of member verification wasn't working correctly.  It wasn't
being triggered most of the time and when it was the check passed because
it was done so soon after the other member crashed that the timestamp
checks in GMSJoinLeave didn't think enough time had passed to declare the
member dead.  This changes the check to request a heartbeat first.

-      suspectMember((DistributedMember)it.next(), reason);
+      verifyMember((DistributedMember)it.next(), reason);
-      this.services.getHealthMonitor().suspect((InternalDistributedMember)mbr, reason);
+      verifyMember(mbr, reason);
-   * membership view.  If it is in the view though we try to connect to it
-   * port to see if it's still around.  If we can't then
-   * suspect processing is initiated on the member with the given reason string.
+   * membership view.  If it is in the view though we try to contact it
+   * to see if it's still around.  If we can't contact it then
+   * suspect messages are sent to initiate final checks
