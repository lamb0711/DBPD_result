+ * applications to connect to the distributed system until it is restarted.
+ * Locators persist membership information in a locatorXXXview.dat file.  This
+ * file is used to recover information about the cluster when a locator starts
+ * if there are no other currently running locators.  It allows the restarted
+ * locator to rejoin the cluster.
