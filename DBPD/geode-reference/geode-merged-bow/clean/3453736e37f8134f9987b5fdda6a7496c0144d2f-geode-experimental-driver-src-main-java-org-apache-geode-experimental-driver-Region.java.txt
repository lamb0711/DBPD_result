GEODE-4662: Add method for retrieving size to the region interface. (#1557)

- Previously, the size (e.g., entry count) of a region
  could be retrieved as part of the region attributes.
  However, only the name of the region (which is
  already known) and the size of the region are data
  that can be affected during runtime; the remaineder
  of the fields of the region attributes were
  administrative. So region attributes has been
  elided in favor of just the size.
-   * Captures a snapshot of the attributes (e.g., size) of this region.
+   * Gets the number of entries in this region.
-   * @return Attributes associated with this region.
+   * @return Non-negative integer count.
-  RegionAttributes getRegionAttributes() throws IOException;
+  int size() throws IOException;
