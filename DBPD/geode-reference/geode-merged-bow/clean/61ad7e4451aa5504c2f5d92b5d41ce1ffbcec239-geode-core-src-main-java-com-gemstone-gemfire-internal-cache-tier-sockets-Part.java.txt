GEODE-1468 client/server messaging can create large objects

After a Message has been sent we invoke clear() on each Part contained by
the Message.  This was nulling out the "part" variable of the Part objects
but if one of these "parts" was a HeapDataOutputStream it might hold a
list of large buffers.  This change set alters Part to close these
streams so that their buffers can be cleared.

-    this.part = null;
+    if (this.part != null) {
+      if (this.part instanceof HeapDataOutputStream) {
+        ((HeapDataOutputStream)this.part).close();
+      }
+      this.part = null;
+    }
