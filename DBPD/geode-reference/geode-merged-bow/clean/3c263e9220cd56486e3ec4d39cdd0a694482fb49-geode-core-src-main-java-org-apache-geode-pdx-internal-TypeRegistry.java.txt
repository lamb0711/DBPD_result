GEODE-4989 CQ reply message fromData method deserializes query results

CqEntry was using DataSerializer.readObject() to read the entry's value
instead of InternalDataSerializer.readUserObject().  The latter is needed
to respect the setting of pdx-read-serialized in the query service's
StreamingReplyMessage.

This closes #1719

+  /**
+   * When this returns true pdx-read-serialized should be respected, which is the
+   * default. Setting this to false disables pdx-read-serialized while deserializing
+   * objects. This takes precendence over setPdxReadSerializedOverride, which affects
+   * the cache's setting of that attribute.
