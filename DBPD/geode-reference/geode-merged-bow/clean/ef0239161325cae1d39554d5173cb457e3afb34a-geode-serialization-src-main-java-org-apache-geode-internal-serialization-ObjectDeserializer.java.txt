GEODE-7720: Review javadocs, API, and code coverage for the geode-serialization module (#4607)

Added more javadocs and moved a few things into an "internal" package
under "serialization".
+/**
+ * An ObjectDeserializer is held by a DSFIDSerializer serialization service. It
+ * is passed to the fromData() method of a DataSerializableFixedID embedded in a
+ * DeserializationContext for use in deserializing data from an input data stream.
+ * The class StaticSerialization also provides helper methods for deserializing
+ * data.
