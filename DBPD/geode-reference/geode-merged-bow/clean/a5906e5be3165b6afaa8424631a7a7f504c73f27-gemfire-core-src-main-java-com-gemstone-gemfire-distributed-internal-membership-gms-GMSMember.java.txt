New unit tests & minor bugfixes

1) new unit tests
2) detection of IDs w/o UUIDs in them in UDP messaging
3) removal of JoinResponse messages - view messages are considered a join-response so we don't need to send both
4) detection of new members admitted by a different coordinator during becomeCoordinator processes (problem found by Jianxia)
5) adjusting the join-timeout if member-timeout is large
