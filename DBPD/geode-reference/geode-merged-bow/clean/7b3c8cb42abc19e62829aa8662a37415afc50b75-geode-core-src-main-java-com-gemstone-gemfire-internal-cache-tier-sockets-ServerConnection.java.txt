GEODE-679 Explore removing SocketIOWithTimeout and other classes related to FD soft leak

SocketUtils was added to avoid a file descriptor "leak" caused by the use of NIO socket
channel selectors.  This was spurred by a HADOOP JIRA ticket that claimed that
sun.misc.Cleaners were being used to close selectors (see
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-4346).  I have verified that Cleaners are
no longer used to close selectors and that SocketUtils is not making any difference in
the number of file descriptors created in servers using NIO selectors using the (recently
deleted) FDDUnitTest with modifications to force clients to close their connections to
the server.

So, this change-set removes SocketUtils and associated classes, reverting all modifications
made to introduce it in GemFire 8.0 to use direct method invokations on sockets.

+      this.handshake.accept(theSocket.getOutputStream(), theSocket.getInputStream()
