GEODE-841: ClientMembershipDUnitTest.testGetNotifiedClients failed

This test threw an exception when it received a client identifier with a
numeric IP address instead of a host name.  On the servers these IDs are
deserialized and a canonical host name is picked up from SocketCreator,
but this is accessing a static cache of host names that may have been
initialized during a test that turned of DNS name lookup altogether in
order to avoid network delays and possible hangs.

The fix is to just clear the cache between tests.

-  private static final Map hostNames = new HashMap();
+  private static final Map<InetAddress, String> hostNames = new HashMap<>();
+  
+  /**
+   * Reset the hostNames caches
+   */
+  public static synchronized void resetHostNameCache() {
+    hostNames.clear();
+  }
