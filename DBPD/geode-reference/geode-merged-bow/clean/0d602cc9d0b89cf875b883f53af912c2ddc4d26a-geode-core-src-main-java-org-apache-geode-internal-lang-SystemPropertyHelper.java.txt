* Add parallel stream for disk store recovery

* Replace synchronized block with CountDownLatch

* Add the new system property parallelDiskStoreRecovery

* Add documentation of the new system property

Authored-by: Jianxia Chen <jchen21@apache.org>
+   * This property turns on/off parallel disk store recovery during cluster restart.
+   * By default, the value is True, which allows parallel disk store recovery by multiple threads.
