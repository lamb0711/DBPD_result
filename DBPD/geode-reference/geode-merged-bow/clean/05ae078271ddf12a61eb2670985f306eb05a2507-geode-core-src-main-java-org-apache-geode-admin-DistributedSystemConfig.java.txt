* GEODE-5817: Restrict default membership range to not conflict with default ports

Currently the default range for membership ports is 1024-65535.  This results
in occasional failures where a random membership port selection will conflict
with the default server or locator port when using all default values.

This change modifies the default range to 41000-61000.  In addition to not
conflicting with any of the default ports (highest is 40404), this is also a
proper subset of the default Linux ephemeral port range (32768-61000).

Also, improving some logging when failing to connect to a locator.
-   * Actual value is <code>[1024,65535]</code>.
+   * Actual value is <code>[41000,61000]</code>.
