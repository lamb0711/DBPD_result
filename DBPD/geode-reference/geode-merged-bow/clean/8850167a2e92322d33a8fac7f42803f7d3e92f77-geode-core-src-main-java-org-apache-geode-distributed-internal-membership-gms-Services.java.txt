GEODE-7658: Removing hostname resolution from TcpSocketCreatorAdapter

We didn't need these methods on TcpSocketCreatorAdapter.
* resolveDns is based on whether network partition detection is enabled, which
we can access directly in membership.

* getHostName uses a static hostname cache that we don't need to use
for membership when creating the local address.

* getLocalHost has moved to a utility in geode-common.
