GEODE-5228: Stale status file is deleted before waiting for status response file (#2850)


* There is a race condition in the product that manifests in tests, the issue is that a stale status file can possibly be read before a new status file is written.
* By deleting an existing status file, the file processor class will now wait until the correct status file is written
* Status files are written in response to a status response file that the file processor creates
+import java.nio.file.Files;
+        deleteExistingStatusResponseFile();
+  private void deleteExistingStatusResponseFile() {
+    try {
+      Files.deleteIfExists(file.toPath());
+    } catch (IOException e) {
+      logger.warn("Unable to delete file", e);
+    }
+  }
