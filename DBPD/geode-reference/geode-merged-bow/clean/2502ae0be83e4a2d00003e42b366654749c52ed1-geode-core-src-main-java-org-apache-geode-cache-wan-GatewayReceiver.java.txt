GEODE-3687: GatewayReceiverImpl constructor and create method updates

- bind-address specified in gemfire.properties is now used to configure Profile and ServerLocations
- removed host field (previously calculated at config time based on hostname-for-sender and bind-address parameters)
  with result then passed to CacheServerImpl.start()
- replaced host field with hostnameForSenders, which is now used (when set) to set hostnameForClients in CacheServerImpl.
- replaced getHost with getHostnameForSenders
- associated tests, including those to set bind-address and server-bind-address through gemfire.properties
+   * Returns the hostname configured by {@link GatewayReceiverFactory#setHostnameForSenders(String)}
+   */
+  public String getHostnameForSenders();
