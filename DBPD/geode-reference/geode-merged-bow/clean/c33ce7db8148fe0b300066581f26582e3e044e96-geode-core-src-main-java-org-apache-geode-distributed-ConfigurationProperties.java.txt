GEODE-1893 remove ability to create a locator without all location services

Deprecated API options for creating a locator without peerLocation or
serverLocation handlers.  There will be documentation work to do since
the docs mention this in at least one place.

-   * communications for the locator. These Communications would be either locator-client or
-   * locator-server
+   * communications for locators and for communicating with locators.
-   * <U>Description</U>: A host name or bind-address and port
-   * ("host[port],peer=<true|false>,server=<true|false>") that are used to start a locator in the
-   * same process as the DistributedSystem. The locator is started when the DistributedSystem
-   * connects, and is stopped when the DistributedSystem disconnects. To start a locator that is not
-   * tied to the DistributedSystem's lifecycle, see the {@link Locator} class in this same package.
+   * <U>Description</U>: A host name or bind-address and port ("host[port]") that are used to start
+   * a locator in the same process as the DistributedSystem. The locator is started when the
+   * DistributedSystem connects, and is stopped when the DistributedSystem disconnects. To start a
+   * locator that is not tied to the DistributedSystem's lifecycle, see the {@link Locator} class in
+   * this same package.
-   * <p>
-   * The peer and server parameters are optional. They specify whether the locator can be used for
-   * peers to discover each other, or for clients to discover peers. By default both are true.
