adding a unit test for initiation of suspect processing when shared/unordered

As part of this work I changed the internal membership listener interfaces to
propagate the reason for initiating suspect processing.  The test gathers
these reasons and asserts that at least one is initiated by TCPConduit.

+  /** string used as the reason for initiating suspect processing */
+  public static final String INITIATING_SUSPECT_PROCESSING = "member unexpectedly shut down shared, unordered connection";
+
-        String reason = "member unexpectedly shut down shared, unordered connection";
-            reason);
+            INITIATING_SUSPECT_PROCESSING);
