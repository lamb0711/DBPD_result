GEODE-6850: change int stats to long (#3713)

The "Int" methods on the statistics interfaces have been deprecated in favor of the corresponding "Long" methods.
The implementation of these deprecated "Int" methods now use the "Long" methods.
The only place this could be visible to a user is if they call Statistics.get(String) or Statistics.get(StatisticDescriptor). Both of these methods return a "Number" instance.
These methods continue to do this and existing code will work fine if it does not try to downcast the Number to a subclass. But for "Int" stats, these methods used to return an "Integer" instance and now return a "Long" instance. If code used to cast to an "Integer" it will now be broken.
Many places in the product now use these deprecated "Int" methods and as of this checkin all those places are now creating a "Long" statistic.

+        &lt;stat name="sampleCount" storage="long" counter="true"&gt;
