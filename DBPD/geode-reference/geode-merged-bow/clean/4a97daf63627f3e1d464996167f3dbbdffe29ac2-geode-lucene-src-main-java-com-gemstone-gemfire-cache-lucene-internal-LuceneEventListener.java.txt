GEODE-11: Fixing some races in Lucene Query DUnits

The tests in LuceneQueryBase had a couple of race conditions. The first
test didn't actually wait for entries to be flushed, so it could run the
query before the flush happens.

The wait for flush test had a test hook with a 1 second pause, but that
may not be long enough depending on what happens on the system. I
changed the test to pause the sender instead, for a deterministic test.

-        
-        if (testHook != null) {
-          testHook.doTestHook("FOUND_AND_BEFORE_PROCESSING_A_EVENT");
-        }
-  
-  public interface TestHook {
-    public void doTestHook(String spot);
-  }
-  public static TestHook testHook;
