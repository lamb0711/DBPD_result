GEODE-4328: Make backup into a task run by a single thread (#1351)


  * The BackupLock had to acquire and release the underlying lock and keep
  * track of who was supposed to be the true owner of the lock due to the fact
  * that the part of backup that acquired the locks was done on a different
  * thread than the one that release the locks. Since the backup task now is
  * completed in a single thread, we can replace it with a ReentrantLock.
