GEODE-6582: get max message size only once

The max message size did not change over the course of execution but was
being re-fetched every time a new message was constructed. To improve
message performance, this value is now static and fetched only once.

-  private final int maxMessageSize;
+  private static final int maxMessageSize =
+      Integer.getInteger(MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE_PROPERTY, DEFAULT_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE);
-    this.maxMessageSize = Integer.getInteger(MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE_PROPERTY, DEFAULT_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE);
