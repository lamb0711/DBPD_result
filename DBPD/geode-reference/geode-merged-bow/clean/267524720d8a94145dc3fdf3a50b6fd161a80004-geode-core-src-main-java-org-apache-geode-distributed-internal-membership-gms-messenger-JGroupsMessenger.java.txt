    GEODE-3588 2 restarts of Locator results in split brain

    Udo's fix for GEODE-870 added a new boolean instance variable to
    GMSJoinLeave to tell its ViewCreator thread to shut down.  This works
    but the state was never being reset after its first use.  This caused
    Subsequent ViewCreator threads to shut down immediately.  The only
    way to fix this condition without a patch is to restart the coordinator node.

    The patch moves this boolean variable to the ViewCreator thread so that
    it is automatically reset when a new ViewCreator is instantiated.

    I also did a little code cleanup, moving GMSJoinLeave methods from the
    end of the file to where its other methods are located and adding
    a setShutdownFlag() method during debugging so I could isolate what
    was happening.

Sarge reviewed the changes for me so this closes #1255
