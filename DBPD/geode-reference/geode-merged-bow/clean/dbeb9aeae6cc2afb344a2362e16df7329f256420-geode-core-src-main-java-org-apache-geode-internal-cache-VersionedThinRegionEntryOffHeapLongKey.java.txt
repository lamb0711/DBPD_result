-   * I needed to add this because I wanted clear to call setValue which normally can only be called while the re is synced.
-   * But if I sync in that code it causes a lock ordering deadlock with the disk regions because they also get a rw lock in clear.
-   * Some hardware platforms do not support CAS on a long. If gemfire is run on one of those the AtomicLongFieldUpdater does a sync
-   * on the re and we will once again be deadlocked.
-   * I don't know if we support any of the hardware platforms that do not have a 64bit CAS. If we do then we can expect deadlocks
-   * on disk regions.
