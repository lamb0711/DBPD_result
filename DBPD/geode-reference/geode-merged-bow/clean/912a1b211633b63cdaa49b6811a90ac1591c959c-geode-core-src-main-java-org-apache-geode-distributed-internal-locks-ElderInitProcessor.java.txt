GEODE-4902: Refactor LogMarker class and usage (#1678)

* GEODE-4902: Refactor LogMarker and usage
* Distinguish those markers at the TRACE and DEBUG levels (now Markers named *_VERBOSE) from those that log at a coarser grainularity (now Markers named *_MARKER)
* Suppress only *_VERBOSE markers by default, from previous behavior of suppressing all markers.
* Refactor some pathological log checks, e.g., change a log from debug to trace when it is gated behind ifTraceEnabled block.
* Remove unused Markers.
* Remove any log marker logic from AdminWaiters exception message generation.  Exceptions now always include a full message.
* Remove marker-gated print to System.out in PersistentOplogSet -- direct calls to System.out should not exist in that class.
* Add marker EVENT_ID_TO_STRING_VERBOSE to explicitly distinguish instance of marker used in logic not immediately consumed by a logger.  The consumption of EventId::toString should only exist at logging in any event.
**
* Remove nearby dead code and dead code detected during marker removal.
* Expand wildcard imports in touched files.
* Remove TODO comments, at least one of which was a decade old.
* Collapse nearby, redundant catch blocks
* Remove empty finally blocks
* Update documentation page to refer to GEODE_VERBOSE, from deprecated GEMFIRE_VERBOSE
* The change in log marker names causes one class to compile larger.  Updated sanctionedDataSerializables.
