GEODE-4387: Removing GemFireCacheImpl.setInstanceForTests

These calls were trying to set the instance variable to a mock instance.
None of them were actually needed. Removing the method.

-  public DistributedSystemBridge(SystemManagementService service) {
+  public DistributedSystemBridge(SystemManagementService service, InternalCache cache) {
-    this.cache = GemFireCacheImpl.getInstance();
+    this.cache = cache;
