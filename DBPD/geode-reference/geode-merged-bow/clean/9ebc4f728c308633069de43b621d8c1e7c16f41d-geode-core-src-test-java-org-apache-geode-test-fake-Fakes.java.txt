Fix for GEODE-3898: Defined Indexes are not Persisted in Cluster Configuration. (#1022)

* GEODE-3898: Defined Indexes are not Persisted in Cluster Configuration.
  . Added JUnit and DUnit tests.
  . CreateDefinedIndexesFunction returns a list of CliFunctionResult and XmlEntity with the indexes created.
  . CreateDefinedIndexesCommand parses the list of results and persists the changes in the cluster configuration service. This is done only once per region whenever at least one member was able to successfully create the index on the region.

+    when(region.getName()).thenReturn(name);
