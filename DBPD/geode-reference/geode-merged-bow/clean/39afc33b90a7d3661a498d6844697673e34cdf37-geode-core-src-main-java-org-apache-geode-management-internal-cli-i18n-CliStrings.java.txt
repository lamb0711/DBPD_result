-      "Connects to Manager by sending HTTP requests to HTTP service hosting the Management REST API.  You must first 'disconnect' in order to reconnect to the Manager via locator or jmx-manager using JMX.";
+      "[Deprecated: inferred by the presence of --url]. Connects to Manager by sending HTTP requests to HTTP service hosting the Management REST API. You must first 'disconnect' in order to reconnect to the Manager via locator or jmx-manager using JMX.";
-      "Whether to use SSL for communication with Locator and/or JMX Manager. If set to \"true\", \"gfsecurity.properties\" will also be read. SSL Options take precedence over the properties file. If none are specified, defaults will be used. The default value for this options is \"false\".";
+      "Whether to use SSL for communication with Locator and/or JMX Manager. If set to \"true\", \"gfsecurity.properties\" will also be read. SSL Options take precedence over the properties file. If none are specified, defaults will be used. The default value for this options is \"false\". This option is only required if JMX is to be used over SSL. For http, the protocol is inferred from the URL.";
