StateFlushOperation flushing/waiting for multicast messages

As part of the State Flush algorithm we record the state of the multicast
protocol in JGroups and send it to the initial image provider.  There the
information is used to wait for the on-wire multicast messages to be
received.

This change set also includes additional JGroupsMessenger tests for better code
coverage and fixes a few Find Bugs problems in that class and GMSJoinLeave.

the long was being incremented, which is not necessarily an atomic operation
on a volatile variable.
