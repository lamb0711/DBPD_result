Changing HealthMonitor.checkIfAvailable() to perform "final" check

Somehow we missed modifying checkIfAvailable to use the "final" check
method after Jianxia implemented the tcp/ip checks.  This modifies
checkIfAvailable to do so.

I also noticed an exception being thrown while closing a PR during
forced-disconnect and changed the method to use getDM instead of
getDistributionManager, which can throw a cancellation exception.

-    DistributionManager dm = (DistributionManager)isys.getDistributionManager();
+    DistributionManager dm = (DistributionManager)isys.getDM();
