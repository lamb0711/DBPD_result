GMSHealthMonitor was only accepting a health-check response to see if a member was alive or not.  This change-set modifies it to allow any message from the suspect to prove that the suspect is alive.  This reduced the amount of suspect processing going on quite a bit, and made it less likely to incorrectly oust a busy member.

GMSMembershipManager was not throwing an exception when distribution was attempted but the manager was shutting down.  This caused large inconsistencies between clients and servers in client/server HA testing.

TCPServer's message to determine the locator's version was using a 2-minute timeout, totally ignoring the timeout passed to it.  It now pays attention to the requested timeout.

A number of tests were using Java assertions instead of JUnit Assert.  I changed all of these in our recently added tests to use the JUnit assertions in case the JUnit jvm doesn't have assertions enabled.
