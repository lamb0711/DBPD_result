GEODE-7177: Extract LogService to a separate submodule

- Extracting LogService and it's dependencies to a separate geode-logging
submodule so that other modules not in geode-core can still use LogService to
get a Logger.

- Removing the use of the logging SPI from LogService
LogService had a dependency on the logging SPI in geode-core. However, this
dependency was unecessary - the LoggingProvider loaded statically in this class
never had `configure` called on it. In addition, the getLogger methods of this
class are merely creating FastLoggers which can live inside geode-logging and
do not need to be pluggable.

- Moved executors that are not dependent on geode-core to geode-logging and
renamed the remaining executors to be CoreLoggingExecutors.

- Refactor the marker interface from Loggable to EntriesCollection
-import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;
-   * Returns a Logger with the specified name.
-   *
-   * @param name The logger name. If null the name of the calling class will be used.
-   * @return The Logger.
-   * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if {@code name} is {@code null} and the calling class
-   *         cannot be determined.
