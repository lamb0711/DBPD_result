GEODE-2410: Lucene afterPrimary and afterSecondary calls pass through the same crit section.

	* afterPrimary and afterSecondary calls are passed through the same critical section.
	* If the caller is primary bucket, it will try to acquire a Dlock on the bucket and create the index repo.
	* If it is secondary it will clean up the repo - close the writer and release the locks.
	* If the primary changes to secondary while waiting for indexes to be created, it will exit from the critical section without acquiring the lock.
