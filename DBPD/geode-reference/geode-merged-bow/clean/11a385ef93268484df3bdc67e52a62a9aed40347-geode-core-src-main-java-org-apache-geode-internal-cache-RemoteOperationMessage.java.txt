GEODE-3940: fix deadlock in backup messages

When backup sends FlushToDisk, PrepareBackup, and FinishBackup,
it will no longer wait for all other members to respond before
doing the same work on its own member.
In addition to preventing a distributed deadlock, this will
also improve how long it takes for a backup to complete.
As part of this work the backup classes and tests have been
moved into their own backup package.

+    InternalCache cache = dm.getCache();
-    return (InternalCache) CacheFactory.getInstance(dm.getSystem());
+    return dm.getExistingCache();
