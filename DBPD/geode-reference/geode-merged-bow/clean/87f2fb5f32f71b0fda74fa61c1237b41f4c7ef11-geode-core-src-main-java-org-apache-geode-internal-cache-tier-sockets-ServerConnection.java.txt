GEODE-2000 client should see server-bind-address in event memberId

The previous fix for this caused confusion as it changed the server
memberId that is used in other places and should remain unchanged.
This change set alters just the listener-invocation code in the client
cache so that client events are based on the ServerLocation information
returned by the Locator or added to the connection pool by applications.

Udo worked with me on this and we found the listener invocation code to
be somewhat convoluted, mixing server-side notification about clients
with client-side notification about servers in the same code.  This
lead to a bit of refactoring in InternalClientMembership to separate the two.

A number of changes had to be made in test code.  Some tests were
requiring that client-side listeners see the server's exact member
ID which is no longer true since the ID being fabricated out of a
ServerLocation doesn't have as much detail as the true member ID and
so is not equal() to it.  Some other test code was creating
ServerLocation objects with non-existent host names.  This is
no longer allowed so we changed these tests to use a numeric IP address.

-        InternalClientMembership.notifyJoined(this.proxyId.getDistributedMember(), true);
+        InternalClientMembership.notifyClientJoined(this.proxyId.getDistributedMember());
-          InternalClientMembership.notifyLeft(proxyId.getDistributedMember(), true);
+          InternalClientMembership.notifyClientLeft(proxyId.getDistributedMember());
-          InternalClientMembership.notifyCrashed(this.proxyId.getDistributedMember(), true);
+          InternalClientMembership.notifyClientCrashed(this.proxyId.getDistributedMember());
