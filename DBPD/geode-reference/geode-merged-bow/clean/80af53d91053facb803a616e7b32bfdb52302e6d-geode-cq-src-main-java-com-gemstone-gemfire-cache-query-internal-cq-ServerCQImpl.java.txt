GEODE-1061: Synchronized update operations and executeCQ happens before updates

* Moved function execution of executeCQ before region updates because if all the updates finish before executeCQ, the test will fail because the cache map size will be zero. This is a feature for PR regions.
* Made all update operations to be synchronous rather than using sleep and infinite while loop to wait.

This closes #121

-   * operation. 
+   * operation.
+   *
+   * NOTE:
+   * In case of RR this map is populated and used as intended.
+   * In case of PR this map will not be populated. If executeCQ happens after update operations
+   * this map will remain empty.
