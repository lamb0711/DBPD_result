GEODE-1777 CI failure: RestAPIsOnMembersFunctionExecutionDUnitTest

Looking through our distributedTest output I see a large number of full
GCs initiated by Metaspace cleanup.  Some of these GCs are taking as long
as 70 seconds and cause nodes to be kicked out of the distributed system.
For Java 8 it's recommended that you estimate requirements for Metaspace
and set XXMetaspaceSize to avoid these full GCs.  Our REST tests seem to
need nearly half a gigabyte of metaspace so I've set it accordingly.  A
precheckin run with this change showed only one GC initiated by
metaspace management, in the geode-web distributedTest suite lasting
1/2 second.
