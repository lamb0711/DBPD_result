GEODE-1304: remove TODO OFFHEAP comments

Tickets have been filed with the information from the removed comments.

This checkin does change LocalRegion validatedCreate/Put/Destroy
to no longer do an offheap release; instead the calling method does.

-            // TODO OFFHEAP: in the future we might want to delay this release
-            // until the "values" VersionedObjectList is released.
-            // But for now "updateValues" copies the off-heap value to the heap.
