GEODE-2420: Enable export logs size estimation and user warning

Adds 'export logs' option, --file-limit-size, to allow user to set
maximun size of the epxorted logs zip file.

When size checking is enabled (file-limit-size > 0) then the check
will also prevent filling up the disk on each member while consolidating
and filtering the logs.

-   * @param baseLogFile if not null, we will export the logs in that directory
-   * @param baseStatsFile if not null, we will export stats in that directory
+   * @param baseLogFile if not null, we will estimate the additional disk space required to filter
+   *        and export the logs in that directory
+   * @param baseStatsFile if not null, we will estimate the additional disk space required to filter
+   *        and export the stats in that directory
