GEODE-1238: fix EntryEventImpl already released

DistributedPut/RemoveAllOperation now have getEventForPosition
as @Unretained. The callers of this method no longer release
since the operation will release these events already at the end
of its life.

+import com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.offheap.annotations.Unretained;
-  protected final RemoveAllEntryData[] removeAllData;
+  /**
+   * Release is called by freeOffHeapResources.
+   */
+  @Retained protected final RemoveAllEntryData[] removeAllData;
-      @Retained
+      @Unretained
-        @Retained EntryEventImpl ev = getEventForPosition(position);
+        @Unretained EntryEventImpl ev = getEventForPosition(position);
-  @Retained
+  @Unretained
+    // owned by this.removeAllData once entry.event = ev is done
-      @Released EntryEventImpl ev = getEventForPosition(i);
+      @Unretained EntryEventImpl ev = getEventForPosition(i);
-        try {
-        } finally {
-          ev.release();
-        }
