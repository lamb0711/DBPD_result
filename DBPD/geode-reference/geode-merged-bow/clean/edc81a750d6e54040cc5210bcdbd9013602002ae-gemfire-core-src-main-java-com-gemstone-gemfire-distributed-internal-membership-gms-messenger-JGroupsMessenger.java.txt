GEODE-77 adding additional test coverage

Test coverage is now > 71% for all membership services.
This also fixes a problem in GMSJoinLeave.join where a member that
was shut down & restarted with a start-locator setting formed a
split-brain.  Now we send a collection of previously attempted
coordinators with FindCoordinator requests, and a member receiving
a join request will check to see if the new member ought to assume
the role of coordinator.  See LocatorDUnitTest.testCollocatedLocatorWithSecurity.
