GEODE-6928 peer-to-peer SSL stream corruption with conserve-sockets=false

Modified the NioSslEngine to not modify the decrypted SSL buffer after
reading a direct-ack response.  This allows the readFully method to
correctly see what bytes have already been consumed and correctly
compact the buffer for subsequent reads, if necessary.

The cluster communication test is modified to check for aborted
connections created (retries) during operation distribution.  Without the
fix for the problem this check would fail.

+  @Override
+  public void doneReadingDirectAck(ByteBuffer unwrappedBuffer) {
+    // nothing needs to be done - the next direct-ack message will be
+    // read into the same buffer and compaction will be done during
+    // read-operations
+  }
