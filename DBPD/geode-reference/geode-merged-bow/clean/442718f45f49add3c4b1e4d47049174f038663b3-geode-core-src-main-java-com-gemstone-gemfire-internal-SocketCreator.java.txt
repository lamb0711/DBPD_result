GEODE-620 Geode SSL configuration is out of date

In reviewing uses of SSL I found that SocketCreator did not have support for
TLSv1.2 and that one of the test classes had a reference to an RC4-based
cipher suite.

-    String[] knownAlgorithms = {"SSL", "SSLv2", "SSLv3", "TLS", "TLSv1", "TLSv1.1"};
+    String[] knownAlgorithms = {"SSL", "SSLv2", "SSLv3", "TLS", "TLSv1", "TLSv1.1", "TLSv1.2"};
