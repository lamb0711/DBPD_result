GEODE-1728: Removing the dispatcher elements from the session filter

The geode session filter is being applied to all requests. Because of
that, all request objects should already be wrapped in a RequestWrapper.
By adding these dispatcher elements to the filter, the filter was being
applied multiple times to the request when a request is forwarded or
included using the RequestDipatcher. That is unnecessary, and
problematic if we can't determine that the request has already been
wrapped.

-  private void processWebXml(final InputStream webXml,
+  public void processWebXml(final InputStream webXml,
-    append(doc, filterMapping, "dispatcher", "FORWARD");
-    append(doc, filterMapping, "dispatcher", "INCLUDE");
-    append(doc, filterMapping, "dispatcher", "REQUEST");
-    append(doc, filterMapping, "dispatcher", "ERROR");
