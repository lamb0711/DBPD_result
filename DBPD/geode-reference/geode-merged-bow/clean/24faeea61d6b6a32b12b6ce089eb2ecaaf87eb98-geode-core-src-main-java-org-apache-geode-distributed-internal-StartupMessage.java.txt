GEODE-7196 Simplify ClusterDistributionManage

remove distribution ID collections from ClusterDistributionManager

move Executors out of DistributionManager implementations

make membership views immutable - we shouldn't install a new view
and then modify it because it's now used directly by other code.

-    return ClusterDistributionManager.WAITING_POOL_EXECUTOR;
+    return OperationExecutors.WAITING_POOL_EXECUTOR;
