new unit tests and code clean-up

New unit tests to increase code coverage.  I also tinkered with
trying to get EclEmma output from DUnit ChildVMs but it seems to
be run in a shutdownHook in parallel with the DUnitLauncher
shutdownHook.

-  public static final StringId GroupMembershipService_MEMBERSHIP_GEMFIRE_RECEIVED_NULL_MESSAGE_FROM__0 = new StringId(1725, "Membership: GemFire received null message from  {0}");
+  // ok to reuse 1725
-  public static final StringId GroupMembershipService_MEMBERSHIP_MESSAGE_HEADERS__0 = new StringId(1727, "Membership: message headers:  {0}");
+  // ok to reuse 1727
