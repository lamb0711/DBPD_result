GEODE-3522: create via load needs to add event to AEQ under same lock as update to local region

* create via load was invoking handleWANEvent prior to obtaining a lock, which allowed rebalance to
  shift the primary between AEQ update and data region update.
* moved call to handleWANEvent from DistributedRegion to BucketRegion to synchronize these two actions.

This closes #744

+      if (getPartitionedRegion().isParallelWanEnabled()) {
+        handleWANEvent(event);
+      }
