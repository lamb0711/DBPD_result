GEODE-4517: Remove getAnyInstancce call from CliUtil.

* CliUtil.getCacheIfExists now takes supplier, but will squelch error and return null as before.
* LogWriter.getInstance now explicitly takes a Cache, to hook into the cache's LogWriter.  This perhaps should be replaced by the LogService logger in a future commit.
* GfshExecutionStrategy adopts the Gfsh shell's LogWriter, since the shell will necessarily have finished instantiating the LogWriter's singleton before GfshExecutionStrategy can instantiate.
* In some instances, the LogWriter has been replaced with the Log4j LogService logger.
* Launcher explicitly passes a null Cache, since it does not yet exist.
* Other minor improvements: visibility, typo corrections, etc.
