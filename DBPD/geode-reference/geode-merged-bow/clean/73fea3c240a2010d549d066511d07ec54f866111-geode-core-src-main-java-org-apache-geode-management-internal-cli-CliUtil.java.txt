GEODE-6285: Make MBean names immutable in loner

Introduce new DistributedMember.getUniqueId which is immutable.

Change MBeanJMXAdapter to use getUniqueId for MBean names
instead of getId when a member name has not been specified.

-        String name = MBeanJMXAdapter.getMemberNameOrId(member);
+        String name = MBeanJMXAdapter.getMemberNameOrUniqueId(member);
