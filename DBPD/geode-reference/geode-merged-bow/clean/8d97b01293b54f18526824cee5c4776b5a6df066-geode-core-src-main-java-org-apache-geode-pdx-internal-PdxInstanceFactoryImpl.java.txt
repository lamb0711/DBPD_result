GEODE-6290: change PdxInstance.equals for empty class name (#3091)

PdxInstance.equals will only act as if an instance has a field
with the default value if the class name is not empty.
If the class name is empty it will now require that both instances
have all the same identity fields.
If the class name is empty then neverDeserialize will be called automatically.

+    if (name.isEmpty()) {
+      expectDomainClass = false;
+    }
