GEODE-185: Fix races in testRegionIdleInvalidate

The test code is now careful to wait for the expiration clock to advance.
A different assertion will be triggered if the expiration clock goes back in time.
Fixed two places in the product expiration code that did not use the expiration clock.

-        return  timeout + System.currentTimeMillis();
+        // Expiration should always use the DSClock instead of the System clock.
+        return  timeout + getLocalRegion().cacheTimeMillis();
