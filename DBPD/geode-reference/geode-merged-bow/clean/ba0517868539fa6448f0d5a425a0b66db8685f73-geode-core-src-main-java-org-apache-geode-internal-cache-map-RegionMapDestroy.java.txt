GEODE-5574: unit test coverage for RegionMapDestroy (#2431)

GEODE-5574: improve unit test coverage of RegionMapDestroy

This is a major rewrite of RegionMapDestroyTest. The test was changed enough that I doubt the diffs will be helpful. I changed it to use mocks except for the class under test.
Each test method now has the pattern "given, do, verify".

This unit test now covers 90% of the class (used to be 60%) and the uncovered code is debug logging and what I think is dead code.

I made one small change to the product to use "putEntryIfAbsent" instead of "getEntryMap().putIfAbsent".

-        regionEntry = (RegionEntry) focusedRegionMap.getEntryMap().putIfAbsent(event.getKey(),
-            newRegionEntry);
+        regionEntry = focusedRegionMap.putEntryIfAbsent(event.getKey(), newRegionEntry);
+          // TODO: this looks like dead code. We only get here if doPart3 is true
+          // but then only happens if !event.isOriginRemote() && concurrencyChecks().
+          // But if we have a versionTag then we will have concurrencyChecks().
+          // If concurrencyChecks is false then this code makes no sense;
+          // we should not be doing anything with version tags in that case.
