GEODE-6803: be able to configure pdx using management rest api (#3638)

* Add PdxManagementController and PdxManager
* add RestEndPoint.getUri for single config object uri for HATOS, make it part of the json response
* rename RuntimeCacheElement to MultiGroupCacheElement since the only usage of it is to support multi group.
* make MultiGroupCacheElement a suplimental interface and list does not have to return MultiGroupCacheElement
* do not require servers to be present in order to create a cache element
* when realizer is not present, assuming the servers needs to be bounced in order for the config change to take effect
-   * this needs to return the uri portion after the /geode-management/v2
+   * this needs to return the uri portion after the /geode-management/v2 that points to the
+   * list of entities
+
+  /**
+   * this needs to return the uri portion after the /geode-management/v2 that points to a single
+   * entity. If the id is not available for the object, this will return null
+   *
+   * @return e.g. /regions/regionA
+   */
+  String getUri();

+  // exists for json serialization purpose
+  default void setUri(String uri) {};
