Adding a couple of simple junit tests for FileSystem

Testing some basic file write and read operations, as well as file
renames and deletes.

I also added some more javadocs to the filesystem classes and moved them
into a separate package.

-package com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.lucene.internal;
+package com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.lucene.internal.filesystem;
+/**
+ * An input stream that reads chunks from
+ * a File saved in the region. This input stream
+ * will keep going back to the region to look for
+ * chunks until nothing is found.
+ */
