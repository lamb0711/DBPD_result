GEODE-867: Reapplying changes to pauseSender to wait for the pause

This reverts commit 09bd5307994bd970bdf3bf4f1d5f302021e8b8e6. In
addition to reapplying the changes, I fixed the issue that required me
to revert those changes. Secondary gateway senders of serial gateways
should not wait for the pause flag to become true, because secondary
dispatchers are already paused in waiting to become primary.

-      while(!isDispatcherWaiting && !isStopped()) {
+      while(!isDispatcherWaiting && !isStopped()
+            && sender.getSenderAdvisor().isPrimary()) {
