GEODE-611: Change findbugs annotations to use ASL library

Swtich the findbugs annotation dependency to use an ASL version
from https://github.com/stephenc/findbugs-annotations.  This
library only supports the SuppressWarning annotation, not
SuppressFBWarning so some source files were updated.

-import com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.InternalDataSerializer;
-import edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressFBWarnings;
-
-  @SuppressFBWarnings(value = "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD", justification = "Only applicable in client DS and in that case too multiple instances do not modify it at the same time.")
+  @edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressWarnings(value = "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD", justification = "Only applicable in client DS and in that case too multiple instances do not modify it at the same time.")
