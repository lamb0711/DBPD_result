+   * Your security manager needs to validate credentials coming from all communication channels.
+   * If you use AuthInitialize to generate your client/peer credentials, then the input of this
+   * method is the output of your AuthInitialize.getCredentials method. But remember that this
+   * method will also need to validate credentials coming from gfsh/jmx/rest client, the framework
+   * is putting the username/password under security-username and security-password keys in the
+   * property, so your securityManager implementation needs to validate these kind of properties
+   * as well.
+   *
-   *        properties
+   *        properties, also the properties generated by your AuthInitialize interface
