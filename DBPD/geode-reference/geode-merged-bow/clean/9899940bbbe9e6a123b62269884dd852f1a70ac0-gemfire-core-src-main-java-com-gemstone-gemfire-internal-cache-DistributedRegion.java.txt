* moved state from SimpleMemoryAllocatorImpl to FreeListManager
* refactored and cleaned up release/free code
* Removed ChunkType and ChunkFactory. They were no longer used by GemFire and complicated the code
* removed BATCH_SIZE; it was an expirement that was not longer used
* combined Chunk and GemFireChunk to the new ObjectChunk class

-import com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.offheap.Chunk;
+import com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.offheap.ObjectChunk;
-    if( incrementUseCountForSqlf && result instanceof Chunk) {
-      ((Chunk)result).retain();
+    if( incrementUseCountForSqlf && result instanceof ObjectChunk) {
