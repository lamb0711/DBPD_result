GEODE-2215: GatewaySenderAdvisor checks the current processor to see if it has started

  * Previously it was checking the top level sender (possibly a concurrent sendor)
  * This allowed a race condition where the top level sender was still starting up
  * but the individual processors were ready to process.  They would check the flag
  * and because the sender was not ready, the processors would act and start initiating
  * failover, which left the processor in a very weird state

-      this.sender.getSenderAdvisor().waitToBecomePrimary();
+      this.sender.getSenderAdvisor().waitToBecomePrimary(this);
