Feature/geode 7796: CI hang in LocatorDUnitTest.testCrashLocatorMultipleTimes (#4706)

* GEODE-7796: CI failure in LocatorDUnitTest

The new test hung during a CI run due to a flaw in Geode.  I'm disabling
it until the flaw is corrected.

* reduce locator-wait-time (seconds, not millis)

also several other changes to fix the underlying failure:
  1) add a synchronization to the services restart thread so only one
  thread is active at a time
  2) shut down membership cleanup executor and avoid creating multiple
  TcpServer executors on auto-reconnect
  3) remove setting the locator as a dependent of the
  InternalDistributedSystem.  This was causing locator.stop() to be
  invoked multiple times (as Dale noticed in his analysis)
  4) when stopping a locator for auto-reconnect wait for it to stop in
  order to avoid creating multiple restart threads when there are
  cascading failures.

-    this.executor = executorServiceSupplier.get();
+    if (this.executor == null || this.executor.isShutdown()) {
+      this.executor = executorServiceSupplier.get();
+    }
