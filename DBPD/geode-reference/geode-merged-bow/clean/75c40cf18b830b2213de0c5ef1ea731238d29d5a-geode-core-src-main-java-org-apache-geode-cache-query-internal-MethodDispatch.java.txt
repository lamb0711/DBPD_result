GEODE-5686: Remove LocalizedStrings

Fixing problems found by lgtm.com

There were a lot of logging calls that were improperly converted from
(MessageFormatString, Argument, Exception) to a form that treated the
Exception as part of the String.format() call.

There were a number of errors in format strings or number of arguments.
MessageFormat was more forgiving about this than String.format().

There were a few dangling MessageFormat specs that needed to be
converted to String.format() specs.

This closes #2757

-              "No applicable and accessible method named ' %s ' was found in class ' %s ' for the argument types  %s",
+              "No applicable and accessible method named ' %s ' was found in class ' %s ' for the argument types %s",
-              "Two or more maximally specific methods were found for the method named ' %s ' in class ' %s ' for the argument types:  %s",
+              "Two or more maximally specific methods were found for the method named ' %s ' in class ' %s ' for the argument types: %s",
