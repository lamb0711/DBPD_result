GEODE-6295: Add Micrometer-based metrics system (#3277)

- Add MetricsSession interface that represents the lifecycle of a meter
  registry, and allows connecting "downstream" registries.
- Add MetricsPublishingService interface that defines a service that
  can be implemented to interact with MetricsSessions by connecting
  "downstream" registries to publish metrics to external monitoring
  systems.
- Add CompositeMeterRegistryFactory whichs handles creating the
  composite meter registry for the cache and defining its common tags.
- Add CacheLifecycleMetricsSession class that loads implementations of
  MetricsPublishingService and manages the cache meter registry based
  on the cache lifecycle.
- InternalCacheBuilder uses CompositeMeterRegistryFactory to create the
  cache meter registry and starts a CacheLifecycleMetricsSession. The
  cache meter registry is passed to GemFireCacheImpl and exposed to
  internal Geode code by InternalCache.getMeterRegistry().
