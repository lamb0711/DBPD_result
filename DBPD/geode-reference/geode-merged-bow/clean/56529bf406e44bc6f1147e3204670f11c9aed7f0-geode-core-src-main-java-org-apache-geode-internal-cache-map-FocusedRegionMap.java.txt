GEODE-92: Fix deadlock issue from previous commit (#3061)

The commit f4b0643 introduced deadlock between concurrent updates with custom expiry which invoked getValue() from the region entry.

* The issue was fixed by making sure lruUpdateCallback is deferred/called at the higher/caller level (before synchronizing region entry).

+import org.apache.geode.internal.cache.eviction.EvictableMap;
-public interface FocusedRegionMap {
+public interface FocusedRegionMap extends EvictableMap {
-  void lruUpdateCallback();
-
-  void resetThreadLocals();
