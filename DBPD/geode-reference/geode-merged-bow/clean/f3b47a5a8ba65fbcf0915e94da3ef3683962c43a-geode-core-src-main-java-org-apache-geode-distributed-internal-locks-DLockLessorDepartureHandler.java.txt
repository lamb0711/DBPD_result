GEODE-4928 DistributedLockService doesn't work as expected while the dlock grantor is initialized

The lock service cleans up transaction locks in a background thread but
cleans up regular dlocks in its membership listener.  This allows you to
get a dlock as soon as a member holding that lock leaves the distributed
system, but its transaction locks stick around for a while.

The fix for this is to wait for the background processing to complete before
acquiring locks and checking for conflicts.
