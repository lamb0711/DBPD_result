GEODE-8144: endpoint identification in servers is not working (#5131)

* GEODE-8144: endpoint identification in servers is not working

Set the SNI server-name field in SSL parameters for p2p communications,
allowing endpoint identification to work properly.

I modified one of the SNI haproxy tests to have keystores with the
proper subject-alternative-names for p2p communications in the docker
containers and for client/server off-platform communications.  I used
Sai's keystore/truststore construction CertificateMaterial/CertStores
classes to generate the stores...

      .sanDnsName("geode") // for inside the docker container
      .sanDnsName("localhost") // for inside the docker container
      .sanIpAddress(InetAddress.getByName("0.0.0.0")) // for inside the docker container
      .sanDnsName(certName) // for client endpoint validation (locator-maeve for instance)

* modified SocketCreator to look for a hostname if one is not present and endpoint verification is enabled

This fixes some problems when running in docker containers

* removed test shell script

* sanction used of getCanonicalHostName() in SocketCreator
-        sb.append(LocalHostUtil.getLocalHost().getHostAddress());
+        sb.append(LocalHostUtil.getLocalHost().getCanonicalHostName());
