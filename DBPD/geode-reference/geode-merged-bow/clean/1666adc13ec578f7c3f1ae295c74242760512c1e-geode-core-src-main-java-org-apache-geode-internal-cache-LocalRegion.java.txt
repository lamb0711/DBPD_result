GEODE-5164: refactor txApplyPut (#1900)

txApplyPut had three large blocks of code that have been refactored into one method.
So applyTxUpdateOnReplicateOrRedundantCopy no longer exists.
Also some methods on RegionMapPut have been renamed for clarity.

+   * Called by AbstractRegionMap txApplyPut when it was told a destroy was also done
+   * by the transaction.
+   */
+  void txApplyPutHandleDidDestroy(Object key) {
+    if (this.entryUserAttributes != null) {
+      this.entryUserAttributes.remove(key);
+    }
+  }
