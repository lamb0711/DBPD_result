GEODE-5440: when we need re-evaluate a entry in a index, we need to pass in the outer value key in the equiJoin. (#2338)

* rewrite the flaky test with an integration test
* pass in the value key when doing the equiJoin
* code clean up.
+    // initial result of index in the observer. 0 means it's not updated yet.
