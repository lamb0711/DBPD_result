GEODE-917: rename gemfire subprojects to geode

Rename the gemfire-* subdirectories to geode-*.  This has the effect
of changing the maven published artifacts as well.  For example,

gemfire-core-1.0.0-incubating.M2-SNAPSHOT.jar

is now

geode-core-1.0.0-incubating.M2-SNAPSHOT.jar

Also took the opportunity to rename gemfire-core-dependencies.jar
to geode-dependencies.jar.

-    IOUtils.appendToPath(GEMFIRE_HOME, "lib", "gemfire-core-dependencies.jar");
+    IOUtils.appendToPath(GEMFIRE_HOME, "lib", "geode-dependencies.jar");
