GEODE-4132: Sending handshake response from locator for new protocol

Changing the locator to send a response to the NewConnectionVersion
message to be consistent with the server. This change also allows the
locator to handle an authentication message, which means that
GetAvailableServers will work if a security manager is enabled and the
client sends a validate authentication message.
