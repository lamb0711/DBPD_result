GEODE-6964: Move geode log4j core classes to geode-log4j

Introduce new Logging and Alerting SPIs. Extract all log4j-core code to
geode-log4j module.

The geode-core module no longer contains log4j2.xml and no longer has a
dependency on log4j-core.

All code that uses log4j-core has moved to the new module geode-log4j.
The log4j2.xml for Geode now lives in geode-log4j as well. These
changes ensure that users have better control over logging including
which backend to use. This should improve user experience when using
Spring Boot.
