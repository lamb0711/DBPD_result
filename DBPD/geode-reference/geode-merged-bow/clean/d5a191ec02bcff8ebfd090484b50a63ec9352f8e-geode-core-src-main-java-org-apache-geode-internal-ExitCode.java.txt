GEODE-7536 - Break Gfsh out into separate module (#4422)


- ManagementUtils is split from CliUtil with non-CLI methods.
- Introduce new CommandProcessor interface which is a CacheService. This
  is implemented by OnlineCommandProcessor and is used in
  MemberMBeanBridge.
- Remove try/catch from ClusterConfigurationStatusRetriever since any
  exception will be handled at a higher level.

-import org.springframework.shell.core.ExitShellRequest;
-
-
-
-  public static ExitCode fromSpring(ExitShellRequest s) {
-    return fromValue(s.getExitCode());
-  }
