GEODE-3328: refactor ConnectCommand

* connect command will prompt for missing ssl configs if ssl is indicated by any options
* command ssl options will override the properties loaded in the file
* reworked connect with ssl so that the configuration won't get cached accidentally.
* have auto connect also prompt for missing ssl configs, not in the socket creator
* change the properties file type in the start server and start locator command to be File instead of String

+
+  @Deprecated
+  String HTTP_SERVICE_SSL_PREFIX = "http-service-ssl-";
