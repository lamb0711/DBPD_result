GEODE-5515: Only initTXMemberId in PartitionMessage if transaction is originated from client. (#2242)

  * Only initTXMemberId in PartitionMessage if transaction is originated from client.

  * Returns client member id in TXState.getOriginatingMember() if it is a client originated transaction
    so it can be correctly set in the PartitionMessage.

-      // GEODE-3679. Even if TXStateProxy has a local transaction,
-      // we still need to forward original txMemberId to other nodes
-      // if the message does not start a new transaction.
-      this.txMemberId = txState.getTxId().getMemberId();
+      txMemberId = txState.getOriginatingMember();
