GEODE-2267: Enhance server/locator startup rules

* be able to return the rule itself so that we can start the server/locator at rule declaration time.
* rearrange the class structure
* do not delete the workingDir if the rule is created with a workingDir (then it's up for the caller to delete it)

-import java.io.File;
+import org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.InternalLocator;
-public class Locator extends Member {
-
-  public Locator(int port, File workingDir, String name) {
-    super(port, workingDir, name);
-  }
+public interface Locator extends Member {
+  InternalLocator getLocator();
