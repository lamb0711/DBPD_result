GEODE-7863: Reduce ServerCQImpl Contention (#4798)

We don't need to lock the entire internal cache for Partitioned
regions so the implementation is now split by region type, this will
us to improve/change them independently in the future.

- Removed redundant checks.
- Keep current behavior for Replicate Regions.
- Use ConcurrentMap instead of locking the entire internal cache on
every operation for Partition Regions.
- Keep the lock on ServerCQImpl instance only while executing the
query and leave stats operations outside of the synchronized block.
-      cqQuery.cqResultKeysInitialized = true;
+      cqQuery.setCqResultsCacheInitialized();
