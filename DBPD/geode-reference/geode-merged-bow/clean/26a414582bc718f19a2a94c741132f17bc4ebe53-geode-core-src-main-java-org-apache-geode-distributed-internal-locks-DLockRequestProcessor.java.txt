GEODE-3314 - Refactoring of DLockService to improve developer QoL. This now closes #683

* Write characterization tests for DLockService.
* Remove debugging code.
* Remove dead code.
* Remove comments.
* Extract the local lock granting into a separate function.

Between the characterization tests we've written and the existing DUnit
tests, the coverage should be fairly adequate.
