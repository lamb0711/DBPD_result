GEODE-420 Changing TcpClient to not be a static class

TcpClient now holds the SocketCreator that it should use to connect to
locators.  It's currently using the cluster SocketCreator but will be
changed to use the one for the Locator component when it's available.

-        RemoteLocatorResponse response = (RemoteLocatorResponse) TcpClient
+        RemoteLocatorResponse response = (RemoteLocatorResponse) new TcpClient()
