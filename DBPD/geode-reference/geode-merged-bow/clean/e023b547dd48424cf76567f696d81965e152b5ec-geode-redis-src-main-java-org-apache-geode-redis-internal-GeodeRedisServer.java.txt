GEODE-8226: change publish to work with non-redis servers present  (#5215)

Changed PubSubDUnitTest to have an additional non-redis server.
This caused multiple tests in it to fail.
Changed the publish code that uses the FunctionService
to only execute the function on members that have the redis data region.
The tests started passing.
