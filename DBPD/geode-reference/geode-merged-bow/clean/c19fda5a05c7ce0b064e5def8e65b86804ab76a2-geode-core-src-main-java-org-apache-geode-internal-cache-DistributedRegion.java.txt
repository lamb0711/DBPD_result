GEODE-5135: Refactor AbstractRegionMap dependencies (#3235)

`BaseRegionMap` will be an abstract base class for `AbstractRegionMap`
and `ProxyRegionMap`. Will move common functionality into this class.
Aims to remove dependency between `AbstractRegionMap` and `ProxyRegionMap`

Move ARMLockTestHook to RegionMap to remove circular dependency
while keeping the impact as small as possible.

Move `forceInvalidateEvent`, `shouldInvokeCallbacks` and
`switchEventOwnerAndOriginRemote` to `BaseRegionMap` to reduce
dependency between `ProxyRegionMap` and `AbstractRegionMap`

Move `createCallbackEvent` from `AbstractRegionMap` to `EntryEventImpl`
This reduces dependecy between `AbstractRegionMap` and `ProxyRegionMap`

Add `EntryEventFactory` class and move `createCallbackEvent`.
Also cleanup `BaseRegionMap` prefix refactoring artifact

Change `EntryEventFactory` to `EntryEventFactoryImpl` that
implements new `EntryEventFactory` interface to make it
availiable for Mockito testing. This requires `createCallbackEvent`
to be a non-static method.

Add private EntryEventFactory field in classes where it is used.
Reduce number of object instantiations.
