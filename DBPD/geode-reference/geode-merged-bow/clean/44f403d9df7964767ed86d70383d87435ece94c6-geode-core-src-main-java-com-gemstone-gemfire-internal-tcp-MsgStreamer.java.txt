GEODE-1304: remove TODO OFFHEAP comments

Tickets have been filed with the information from the removed comments.

This checkin does change LocalRegion validatedCreate/Put/Destroy
to no longer do an offheap release; instead the calling method does.

-  // TODO OFFHEAP: instead of MsgStreamer extending OutputStream
-  // we could have it extends HeapDataOutputStream.
-  // HDOS can now be given a direct ByteBuffer and told
-  // to not copy large byte sequences it is given.
-  // Also be it being a HDOS we can take advantage of code
-  // that is already optimized to pass Chunk direct ByteBuffers.
-    // TODO OFFHEAP: if len > remainingSpace and isOverflowMode() then
-    // (and the overflow HDOS has doNotCopy set?) it is probably better to not copy part of
-    // bb to this.buffer and then add the remainder of it to the HDOS. Instead
-    // we can just add the whole bb to the HDOS.
-    // TODO OFFHEAP: update this class to take into account the "noCopy" mode added to HDOS and that we might be adding direct ByteBuffers to this.
