GEODE-1428: deliver event synchronously if it is rejected

Changed unit test to use close instead of emergencyClose.
Doing this caused an event to be sent after the async thread
pool was shutdown which resulted in a suspect warning without
this fix.

-            logger.warn(LocalizedMessage.create(LocalizedStrings.LocalRegion_0_EVENT_NOT_DISPATCHED_DUE_TO_REJECTED_EXECUTION), rex);
+            dispatchEvent(this, event, op);
