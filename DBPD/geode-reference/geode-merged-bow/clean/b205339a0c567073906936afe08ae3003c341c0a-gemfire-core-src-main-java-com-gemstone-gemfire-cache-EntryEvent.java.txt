Merge branch 'feature/GEODE-8' into develop

+ * <p>
+ * If this event originated from a region stored off heap then this event can
+ * only be used as long as the notification method that obtained it has not returned.
+ * For example in your implementation of {@link CacheListener#afterUpdate(EntryEvent)} the event parameter
+ * is only valid until your afterUpdate method returns. It is not safe to store instances of this
+ * class and use them later when using off heap storage.
+ * Attempts to access off-heap data from this event after it has expired will result in an
+ * IllegalStateException.
+   * @throws IllegalStateException if off-heap and called after the method that was passed this EntryEvent returns.
+   * @throws IllegalStateException if off-heap and called after the method that was passed this EntryEvent returns.
