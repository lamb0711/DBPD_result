GEODE-1304: remove TODO OFFHEAP comments

Tickets have been filed with the information from the removed comments.

This checkin does change LocalRegion validatedCreate/Put/Destroy
to no longer do an offheap release; instead the calling method does.

-      // TODO OFFHEAP: this is going to break once we have a ByteSource that is offheap.
-      // Should we just copy the offheap ByteSource to a heap byte[] here or change
-      // PdxString to work with a ByteSource?
