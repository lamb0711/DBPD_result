GEODE-588: CI failure in LocatorDUnitTest

TcpServer waits up to 60 seconds for its executor pool to shut down
but InternalLocator.stop() also waits for 60 seconds for TcpServer
to shut down.  I made the stop() wait time dependent on TcpServer's
wait time and added some buffer.  I also added an expected-exception
for the suspect string that causes GEODE-588.

-  private static final long SHUTDOWN_WAIT_TIME = 60 * 1000;
+  public static final long SHUTDOWN_WAIT_TIME = 60 * 1000;
