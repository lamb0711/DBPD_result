GEODE-11: Support indexing values that are Strings or Numbers

Adding support to index values that are strings or numbers, by providing
a special field name LuceneIndex.REGION_VALUE_FIELD that indicates the
entire value should be indexed.

+  /**
+   * A special field name that indicates that the entire region value should
+   * be indexed. This will only work if the region value is a String or Number, in
+   * which case a lucene document will be created with a single field with this name.
+   */
+  String REGION_VALUE_FIELD = "__REGION_VALUE_FIELD";
+
+   * @param fields The fields of the object to index. Only fields listed here will be stored
+   * in the index. Fields should map to PDX fieldNames if the object is serialized with PDX, or
+   * to java fields on the object otherwise. The special field name {{@link #REGION_VALUE_FIELD}}
+   * indicates that the entire value should be stored as a single field in the index.
-   * @param analyzerPerField analyzer per field map
+   * @param analyzerPerField A map of fields to analyzers. See {{@link #createIndex(String, String, String...)}}
+   * for details on valid values for fields. Each field will be tokenized using the provided Analyzer.
