GEODE-1755 Clean up TODOs in membership, communications and serialization components

+          /*
+           * TODO - The use of acquireConnection should be removed
+           * from the gateway code. This method is fine for tests,
+           * but these connections should really be managed inside
+           * the pool code. If the gateway needs to persistent connection
+           * to a single server, which should create have the OpExecutor
+           * that holds a reference to the connection (similar to the way
+           * we do with thread local connections).
+           * Use {@link ExecutablePool#setupServerAffinity(boolean)} for
+           * gateway code
