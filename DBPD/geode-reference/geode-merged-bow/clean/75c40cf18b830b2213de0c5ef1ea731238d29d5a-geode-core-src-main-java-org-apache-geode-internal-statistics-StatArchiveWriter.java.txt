GEODE-5686: Remove LocalizedStrings

Fixing problems found by lgtm.com

There were a lot of logging calls that were improperly converted from
(MessageFormatString, Argument, Exception) to a form that treated the
Exception as part of the String.format() call.

There were a number of errors in format strings or number of arguments.
MessageFormat was more forgiving about this than String.format().

There were a few dangling MessageFormat specs that needed to be
converted to String.format() specs.

This closes #2757

-            String.format("timeStamp delta  %s  was greater than  %s",
+            String.format("timeStamp delta %s was greater than %s",
-            String.format("Expected idx to be greater than 2. It was  %s  for the value  %s",
+            String.format("Expected idx to be greater than 2. It was %s for the value %s",
-        throw new InternalGemFireException(String.format("Unexpected type code  %s",
+        throw new InternalGemFireException(String.format("Unexpected type code %s",
