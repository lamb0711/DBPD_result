Adding a couple of simple junit tests for FileSystem

Testing some basic file write and read operations, as well as file
renames and deletes.

I also added some more javadocs to the filesystem classes and moved them
into a separate package.

-package com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.lucene.internal;
+package com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.lucene.internal.filesystem;
+    // TODO - What is the state of the system if 
+    // things crash without close?
+    // Seems like a file metadata will be out of sync
+
