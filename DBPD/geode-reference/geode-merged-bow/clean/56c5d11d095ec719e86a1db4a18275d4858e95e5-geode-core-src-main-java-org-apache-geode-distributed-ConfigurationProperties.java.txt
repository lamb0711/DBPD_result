GEODE-5323 ConfigurationProperties says the default socket-lease-time is 15000ms but it is 60000ms

changed the documentation to note the correct default value for this
setting

-   * never expire. This property is ignored if "conserve-sockets" is true. <U>Default</U>: "15000"
+   * never expire. This property is ignored if "conserve-sockets" is true. <U>Default</U>: "60000"
