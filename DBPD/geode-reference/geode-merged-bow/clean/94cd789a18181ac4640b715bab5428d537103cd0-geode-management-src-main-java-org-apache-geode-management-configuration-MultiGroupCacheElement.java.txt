GEODE-6811: refactor MemberStatus in ClusterManagementResult (#3709)

* change memberStatus in ClusterManagementResult to use RealizationResult
+/**
+ * Implement this interface only when the CacheElement can span multiple groups.
+ *
+ * The implementation of getGroup should already be implemented by CacheElement
+ *
+ * If implementation of getGroups should be simply "return groups" if the object is already a
+ * CacheElement.
+ *
+ * When implementing this interface, the CacheElement also needs to specifically implement
+ * Object.equals() method
