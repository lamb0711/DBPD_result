GEODE-73: Removing unnecessary P2P backward-compatibility serialization code

Geode 1.0 will not be backward-compatible with GemFire 8.X (and older) peers
due to upgrading to Apache 2.0 licensed JGroups.  This removes the
serialization code that maintained that backward-compatibility.

This does not remove backward-compatibility code for client/server
communications, so older GemFire clients can still be used with Geode 1.0.
