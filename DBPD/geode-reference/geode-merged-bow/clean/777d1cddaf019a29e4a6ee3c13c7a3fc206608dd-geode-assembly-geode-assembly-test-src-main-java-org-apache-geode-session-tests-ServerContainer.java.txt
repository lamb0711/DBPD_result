GEODE-6270: Correctly set up user-provided client cache regions for session modules (#3074)

- If a user provides their own client cache xml, we need to ensure that the
  SessionExpirationCacheListener, as well as any necessary interest
  registration, has been set up.
- Update build.xml so that these tests can be run from IntelliJ
-      ContainerInstall.editXMLFile(getSystemProperty("cache-xml-file"), "locator", "pool",
+      ContainerInstall.editXMLFile(cacheXMLFile.getAbsolutePath(), "locator", "pool",
