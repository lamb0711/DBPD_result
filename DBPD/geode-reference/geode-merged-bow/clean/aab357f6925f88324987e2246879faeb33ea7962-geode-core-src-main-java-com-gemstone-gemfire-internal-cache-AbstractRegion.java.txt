GEODE-249: Retry on local node does not overwrite previously retrieved results

If a query on a remote node fails and buckets are determined to have moved to
the local node, a retry of the query is executed on the local node.  However
the code currently will overwrite any results the local node had already
correctly retrieved.

Added new junit test for PartitionedRegionQueryEvaluator and renamed existing
test to PartitionedRegionQueryEvaluatorIntegrationTest
