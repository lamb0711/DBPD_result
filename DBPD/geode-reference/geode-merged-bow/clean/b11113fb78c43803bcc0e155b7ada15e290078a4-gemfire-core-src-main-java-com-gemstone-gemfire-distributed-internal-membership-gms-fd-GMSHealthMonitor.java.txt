ViewCreator thread sends another message when any member doesn't ack back to
prepared view. And then it waits on future as this can happen for multiple members.
In this case, If those members are not responsive and other thread already determined that,
then we don't need to wait for those members. Thus now viewCreator thread checks
RemoveMember message for those members while waiting for response.
Another minor fix in same area.
And added unit test for that

-      List<SuspectRequest> sMembers, NetView cv, InternalDistributedMember localAddress) {
+      List<SuspectRequest> sMembers, final NetView cv, InternalDistributedMember localAddress) {
-              NetView view = currentView;
-              int port = view.getFailureDetectionPort(mbr);
+              int port = cv.getFailureDetectionPort(mbr);
-                  logger.debug("\ncurrent view: {}\nports: {}", view, Arrays.toString(view.getFailureDetectionPorts()));
+                  logger.debug("\ncurrent view: {}\nports: {}", cv, Arrays.toString(cv.getFailureDetectionPorts()));
