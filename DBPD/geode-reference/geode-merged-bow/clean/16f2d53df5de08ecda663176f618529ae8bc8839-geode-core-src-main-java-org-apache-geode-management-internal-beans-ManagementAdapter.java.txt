GEODE-4387: Removing GemFireCacheImpl.setInstanceForTests

These calls were trying to set the instance variable to a mock instance.
None of them were actually needed. Removing the method.

-    DistributedSystemBridge dsBridge = new DistributedSystemBridge(service);
+    DistributedSystemBridge dsBridge = new DistributedSystemBridge(service, internalCache);
