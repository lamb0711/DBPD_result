GEODE-5686: Remove LocalizedStrings

Fixing problems found by lgtm.com

There were a lot of logging calls that were improperly converted from
(MessageFormatString, Argument, Exception) to a form that treated the
Exception as part of the String.format() call.

There were a number of errors in format strings or number of arguments.
MessageFormat was more forgiving about this than String.format().

There were a few dangling MessageFormat specs that needed to be
converted to String.format() specs.

This closes #2757

-        throw new InternalGemFireError(String.format("Unknown member type:  %s",
+        throw new InternalGemFireError(String.format("Unknown member type: %s",
-                String.format("No startup replies from:  %s",
+                String.format("No startup replies from: %s",
-                  "Received no connection acknowledgments from any of the  %s  senior cache members:  %s",
+                  "Received no connection acknowledgments from any of the %s senior cache members: %s",
