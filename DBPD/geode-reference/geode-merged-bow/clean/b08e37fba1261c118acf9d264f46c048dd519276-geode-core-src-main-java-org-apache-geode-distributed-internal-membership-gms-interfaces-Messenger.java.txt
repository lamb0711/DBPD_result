GEODE-5546 auto-reconnecting member reuses old address including vmViewId

Old membership IDs are now retained in JGroupsMessenger and GMSJoinLeave
uses a new method, Messenger.isOldMembershipIdentifier(), to avoid accepting
a prepared view that contains an old identity.

GMSJoinLeave is also modified to send an immediate removal message to
servers that are no longer members of the cluster but are attempting to interact
with the cluster.

This closes #2286
