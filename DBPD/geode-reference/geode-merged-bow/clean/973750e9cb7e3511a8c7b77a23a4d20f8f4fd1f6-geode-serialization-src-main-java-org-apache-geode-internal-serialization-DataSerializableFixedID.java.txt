ByteArrayWrapper now implementes DataSerializableFixedID which should save us 40 bytes each time it is serialized. (#5180)

- It no longer caches its "hash" and "string" form which will cut down its memory overhead by over 70%.
- When we convert a sequence of bytes to a String, the Coder no longer calls intern which will also save some memory and time.
-  // 70 unused
+  byte REDIS_BYTE_ARRAY_WRAPPER = 70;
