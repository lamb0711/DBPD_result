GEODE-3413: overhaul launcher and process classes and tests

This is primarily an overall of all ServerLauncher and LocatorLauncher
tests and org.apache.geode.internal.process tests. The main classes in
org.apachage.geode.internal.process package are also cleaned up.

In addition, several bugs involving these classes and tests are fixed.

Here is the complete list of tickets that are resolved in this overhaul:

* GEODE-1229: LocatorLauncherRemoteJUnitTest.testStartOverwritesStalePidFile
* GEODE-2791: LocatorLauncherAssemblyIntegrationTest.testLocatorStopsWhenJmxPortIsNonZero fails intermittently with AssertionError
* GEODE-1308: CI failure: LocatorLauncherTest.testSetBindAddressToNonLocalHost
* GEODE-1309: CI failure: ServerLauncherTest.testSetServerBindAddressToNonLocalHost
* GEODE-3193: locator pid file is removed even if there was a problem while shutting down
* GEODE-3413: Overhaul launcher tests and process tests
* GEODE-3414: Cleanup org.apache.geode.internal.process package

Note I moved all useful tests from LocatorLauncherAssemblyIntegrationTest
into the other launcher tests in geode-core.
