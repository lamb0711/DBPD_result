GEODE-77 install membership view even if quorum has been lost

If enable-network-partition-detection isn't enabled we need to go ahead
and install a new membership view when quorum has been lost.

-    logger.info("received new view: {}", newView);
+    logger.info("received new view: {}\nold view is: {}", newView, currentView);
+          return;
-        return;
