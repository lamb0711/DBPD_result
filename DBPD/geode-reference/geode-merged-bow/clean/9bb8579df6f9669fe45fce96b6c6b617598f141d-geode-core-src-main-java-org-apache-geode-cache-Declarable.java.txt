GEODE-6280: Create new public module for the Management API (#3083)

- This moves the classes under `org.apache.geode.cache.configuration` package
  into a public module: `geode-managament`. The intent is that this module
  will have no dependencies to `geode-core` but will allow consumers to perform
  administration tasks (creating regions, etc.).
- `geode-core` will now depend on both `geode-management` as well as
  `geode-common` (transitively). Suggestions on how to improve these new
  dependencies are welcome.
