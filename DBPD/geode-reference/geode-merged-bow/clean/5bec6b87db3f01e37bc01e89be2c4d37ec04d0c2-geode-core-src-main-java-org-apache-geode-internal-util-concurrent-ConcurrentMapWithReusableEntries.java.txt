GEODE-4590: pass executor in to clear (#1392)

Instead of looking up the waiting pool executor
from a singleton, it is now passed in based on
the owner of the AbstractRegionMap.
+import java.util.concurrent.Executor;
+
+  /**
+   * Clear the map. If any work needs to be done asynchronously then use the given executor.
+   *
+   * @param executor possibly null. If it is null and asynchronous work needs to be done then a new
+   *        Thread is created.
+   */
+  void clearWithExecutor(Executor executor);
