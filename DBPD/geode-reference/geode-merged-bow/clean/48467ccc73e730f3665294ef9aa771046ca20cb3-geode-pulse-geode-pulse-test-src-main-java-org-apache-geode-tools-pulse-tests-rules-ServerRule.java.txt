GEODE-7157: SSLConfig&SSLConf..Factory thread-safe

SSLConfig and SSLConfigFactory have been changed to be
thread-safe by means of the following:

* SSLConfig has been converted into an immutable class

* The registeredSSLConfig HashMap member of SSLConfigurationFactory
  has been changed into a ConcurrentHashMap and accesses to this
  map other than put and get has been synchronized.

-    jetty.createJettyServer(LOCALHOST, httpPort, new SSLConfig());
+    jetty.createJettyServer(LOCALHOST, httpPort, new SSLConfig.Builder().build());
