GEODE-1542 shared/unordered tcp/ip connection times out, initiating suspicion

This disables timing out of shared/unordered TcpConduit connections.  We don't
want them to time out because we are using them to initiate suspect processing
on other members.

The ticket also pointed out a problem with the "final check" mechanism in
the health monitor.  I tracked that down to improper use of SocketCreator
to create the server-socket in GMSHealthMonitor.  It was creating sn SSL
socket if SSL is enabled but the client-side of the check uses non-SSL
sockets.  I changed the server to use non-SSL sockets as well since no
useful information is sent over the final-check TCP/IP connections & they
need to be lightweight and fast.

While looking at logs I also found that the heartbeat request sent at the
beginning of a final-check had a request-ID even though it's not waiting
for a response.  That causes processing of the response to do more work
than necessary so I changed it to remove the request-ID from the message.

+  /**
+   * If no response is desired the requestId can be reset by invoking
+   * this method
+   */
+  public void clearRequestId() {
+    requestId = -1;
+  }
