GEODE-2642 Fixed ping thread issue on client.

Client ping thread wakes up every "ping-interval" and then it checks
whether someone already did some operation on that server or not, in the
last ping-interval. If there is some operation, then it doesn't ping
server and wakes up again after ping-interval.Otherwise ot pings the
server. But if operation happens just start of the previous ping-interval
then client thread will ping server after more than ping-interval.
This can cause an issue. Thus to avoid this race condition, now ping
thread will wake up in ping-interval/2 and will make sure it pings server.

-    this.pingIntervalNanos = pool.getPingInterval() * NANOS_PER_MS;
+    this.pingIntervalNanos = ((pool.getPingInterval() + 1) / 2) * NANOS_PER_MS;
