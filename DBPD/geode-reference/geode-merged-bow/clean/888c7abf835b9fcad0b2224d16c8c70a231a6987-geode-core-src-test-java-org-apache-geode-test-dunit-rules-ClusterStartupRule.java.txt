GEODE-4885: Change ClusterStartupRule to launch DUnit during setUp

Prevent ClusterStartupRule from launching DUnit during construction.
Tests that have a static ClusterStartupRule are class-loaded even
during test runs for other JUnit categories.

* launch DUnit in ClusterStartupRule before instead of its constructor

-    DUnitLauncher.launchIfNeeded();
+    DUnitLauncher.launchIfNeeded();
