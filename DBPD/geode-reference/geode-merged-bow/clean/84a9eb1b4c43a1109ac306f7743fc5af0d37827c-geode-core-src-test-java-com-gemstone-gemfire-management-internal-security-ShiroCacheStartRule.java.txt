GEODE-17: make geode authorization case-sensitive since our region names are case sensitive

* Specify case sensitive when creating the permission context
* Specify case sensitive when resolving the permission from shiro-ini file
* rename shiro-init to security-shiro-init since it's security related in DistributionConfig
* For DATA operations, a "NULL" regionName is used when regionName couldn't be resolved yet. Since for permissions,
  DATA:READ is different from DATA:READ:NULL

-    properties.put(DistributionConfig.SHIRO_INIT_NAME, shiroFile);
+    properties.put(DistributionConfig.SECURITY_SHIRO_INIT_NAME, shiroFile);
