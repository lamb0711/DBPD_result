Revert "GEODE-2804 Update InetSocketAddress, when there is IOException."

This reverts commit e216fde1e4b1613bde22112cfb1544be022c3aac.

We are reverting previous fix. As that fix caused some more issues.
Currently we cache InetAddress in Geode. Solution was to cache hostname
but in certain cases that's not enough.

-import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
-    InetSocketAddress inetSockAddr = new InetSocketAddress(networkAddress, locatorPort);
-      Object responseFromServer = client.requestToServer(inetSockAddr, SINGLETON, msTimeout, true);
+      Object responseFromServer =
+          client.requestToServer(networkAddress, locatorPort, SINGLETON, msTimeout);
