GEODE-953: Cleanup geode-junit

* cleanup geode-junit usage of JUnit Rules to ensure JUnit code is always extended rather than copied
* change CRLF to LF
* remove @author tags
* fix all javadocs
* fix formatting
* add new tests
* remove ExpectedTimeout and ExpectedTimeoutTest (they were dupes of ExpectedTimeoutRule and ExpectedTimeoutRuleTest)
* use serialization by reflection for serializable subclasses of JUnit rules that lack sufficient ability to subclass
* repackage rule tests to same package as rules
* repackage serializable rules into serializable sub-package
