GEODE-77 fixing the inability to create multiple MembershipManagers ina single JVM

The static MemberAttributes.DEFAULT was being used to pull together all
of the bits of a new members identity (InternalDistributedMember) but
this prevented multiple MembershipManagers from being instantiated w/o
ones identity bleeding into anothers.  Now the MembershipManager is the
assembling a single InternalDistributedMember instance, putting info
into it as it becomes available.  A new unit test ensures that this is
functioning correctly.

-  public static final StringId GroupMembershipService_entered_into_membership_in_group_0_with_id_1 = new StringId(1181, "Finished joining (took {}ms).");
+  public static final StringId GroupMembershipService_entered_into_membership_in_group_0_with_id_1 = new StringId(1181, "Finished joining (took {0}ms).");
