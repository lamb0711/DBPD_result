GEODE-5686: Remove LocalizedStrings

Fixing a few places that had %s format specifiers but needed to use the
log4j curly braces.

-      logger.info("GemFireMemcachedServer on port %s is shutting down",
+      logger.info("GemFireMemcachedServer on port {} is shutting down",
-      logger.info("Rest Server on port %s is shutting down",
+      logger.info("Rest Server on port {} is shutting down",
