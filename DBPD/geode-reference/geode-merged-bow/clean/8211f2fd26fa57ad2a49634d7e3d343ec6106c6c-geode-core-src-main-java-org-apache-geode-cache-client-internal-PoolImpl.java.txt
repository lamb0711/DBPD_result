GEODE-3609 Small AcceptorImpl refactor (#772)

Use one CommunicationMode variable, not 3.

Also, refactor the selector and not-selector cases into separate
methods.

I'm not changing the `ServerConnectionFactory` because it more or less
passes straight through to `ServerConnection`, and there's too much
legacy code there to change easily.
