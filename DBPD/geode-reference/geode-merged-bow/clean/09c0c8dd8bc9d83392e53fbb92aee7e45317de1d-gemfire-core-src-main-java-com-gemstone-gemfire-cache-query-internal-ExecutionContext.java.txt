GEODE-890:CompiledLike member variables are not thread safe

Member variables in CompiledLike need to be thread safe.
Added the member variables into the execution context, this should
prevent threads/queries from sharing these variable values and
prevent a possible stack overflow/ infinite loop from occuring.

Added a Multithreaded test helper and test to reproduce the original issue.
