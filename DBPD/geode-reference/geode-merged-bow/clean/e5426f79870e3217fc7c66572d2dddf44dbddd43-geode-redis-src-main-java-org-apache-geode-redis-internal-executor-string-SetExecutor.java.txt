change more string commands to have CommandFunction support (#5184)

* CommandFunction now supports getrange, setrange, bitcount, bitop, bitpos, getbit, setbit, incrbyfloat, mget, and strlen.

Added integration test coverage for untested string commands.

-  private final String SUCCESS = "OK";
+  private static final String SUCCESS = "OK";
