GEODE-7196 Simplify ClusterDistributionManage

remove distribution ID collections from ClusterDistributionManager

move Executors out of DistributionManager implementations

make membership views immutable - we shouldn't install a new view
and then modify it because it's now used directly by other code.

-import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock;
+import java.util.function.Function;
-   * Returns an object that is used to sync access to the view. While this lock is held the view
-   * can't change.
-   *
-   * @since GemFire 5.7
+   * execute code with the membership view locked so that it doesn't change
-  ReadWriteLock getViewLock();
+  <V> V doWithViewLocked(Function<MembershipManager, V> function);
+  /**
+   * return a list of all members excluding those in the process of shutting down
+   */
+  Set<InternalDistributedMember> getMembersNotShuttingDown();
