GEODE-5686: Remove LocalizedStrings

Fixing problems found by lgtm.com

There were a lot of logging calls that were improperly converted from
(MessageFormatString, Argument, Exception) to a form that treated the
Exception as part of the String.format() call.

There were a number of errors in format strings or number of arguments.
MessageFormat was more forgiving about this than String.format().

There were a few dangling MessageFormat specs that needed to be
converted to String.format() specs.

This closes #2757

-      // bridge server and will need to enforce the member limit
+      // cache server and will need to enforce the member limit
-              String.format("No listeners permitted after shutdown:  %s",
+              String.format("No listeners permitted after shutdown: %s",
-            String.format("While starting cache server  %s", server),
+            String.format("While starting cache server %s", server),
