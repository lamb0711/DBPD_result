Addressing minor issues in javadocs and code reported by LooksGoodToMe.

-   * Sets the cache writer for the next <code>PartitionAttributes</code> created. <i>Currently
-   * unsupported for the early access release.</i>
-   *
-   * @param cacheWriter the cache writer or null if no cache writer
-   * @return this public PartitionAttributesFactory<K,V> setCacheWriter(CacheWriter cacheWriter) {
-   *         this.partitionAttributes.setCacheWriter(cacheWriter); return this; }
