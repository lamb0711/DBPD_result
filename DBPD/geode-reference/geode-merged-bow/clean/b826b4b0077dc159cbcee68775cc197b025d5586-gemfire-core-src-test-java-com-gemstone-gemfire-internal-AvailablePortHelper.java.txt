implementation of AvailablePort.isPortAvailable for multicast

The AvailablePort utility has not had support for finding a free multicast
port since feature/GEODE-77 was merged to the develop branch.  This change-
set enables the old multicast code in AvailablePort and implements the
check & response for its datagrams in JGroupsMessenger.  The JGroups
transport method for receiving packets is overridden to look for these
datagrams and respond to them.

I also renamed AvailablePort.JGroups to AvailablePort.MULTICAST, which
describes the kind of port that's being tested a little better.

-      int port = AvailablePort.getRandomAvailablePort(AvailablePort.JGROUPS);
+      int port = AvailablePort.getRandomAvailablePort(AvailablePort.MULTICAST);
