GEODE-7720: Review javadocs, API, and code coverage for the geode-serialization module (#4607)

Added more javadocs and moved a few things into an "internal" package
under "serialization".
+import org.apache.geode.internal.serialization.internal.DSFIDSerializerImpl;
+
+/**
+ * DSFIDSerializerFactory can be used to create a serialization service.
+ * You may establish an overriding ObjectSerializer and ObjectDeserializer
+ * to handle types of serialization other than DataSerializableFixedID and
+ * BasicSerializable. Geode-core does this and adds a large number of other
+ * types of serialization including PDX and DataSerializable.
+ * <p>
+ * Once a DSFIDSerializer is created you should register your
+ * DataSerializableFixedID classes with it using registerDSFID(). You can
+ * find examples of doing this in other modules by looking for uses of this
+ * method.
