GEODE-7479: Change Membership interface to use MemberIdentifier interface (#4420)

Changing all classes in Membership to be parameterized by an ID type,
which extends MemberIdentifier. This allows core to create a membership
system that manages InternalDistributedMember objects in a type safe
way.

Removing all uses of InternalDistributedMember, DistributedMember, and
friends from within the membership code.

+    transport = getProtocolStack().getTransport();
