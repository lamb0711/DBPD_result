GEODE-5686: Remove LocalizedStrings

This removes the LocalizedStrings class and most uses of LogWriterI18n.
The I18n interfaces are still in place and still work since they're only
deprecated but there are no longer any uses of the StringID logging methods.

Going forward everyone should use the Log4j logging facility.  If you
must use the deprecated LogWriter use that version and not
LogWriterI18n.

-import org.apache.geode.internal.i18n.LocalizedStrings;
-    String text = LocalizedStrings.BackupService_README.toLocalizedString();
+    String text =
+        "This directory contains a backup of the persistent data for a single gemfire VM. The layout is:diskstoresA backup of the persistent disk stores in the VMuserAny files specified by the backup element in the cache.xml file.configThe cache.xml and gemfire.properties for the backed up member.restore.[sh|bat]A script to restore the backup.Please note that the config is not restored, only the diskstores and user files.";
