-        // The drf file needs to be deleted, especially when the disk-store is *only* used by
-        // gateway-senders, otherwise there will be orphaned drfs that are never deleted by
-        // compaction (unless there are pending events in the queue upon restart, aka there's a crf,
-        // or a manual compaction is executed).
