GEODE-1304: remove TODO OFFHEAP comments

Tickets have been filed with the information from the removed comments.

This checkin does change LocalRegion validatedCreate/Put/Destroy
to no longer do an offheap release; instead the calling method does.

-    // TODO OFFHEAP: this code end up calling chan.write at least once for each DirectByteBuffer in this HDOS.
-    // It will combine consecutive heap ByteBuffers into a write call.
-    // It would be better to do one chan.write call with an array of ByteBuffers like sendTo(SocketChannel) does.
