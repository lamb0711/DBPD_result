GEODE-5985 Possible integer overflow

We had a number of calculations that were taking place with ints instead
of longs.  I've modified them to, in most places, just add an L to the
constant multiplier.  In other places I had to change a variable type
from int to long.

There were a few places that were also assigning a long to an int
variable or an int to a byte variable.  In these I added bit AND
operators to reduce the chances of overflow.

IndexElemArray needed a lot of work due to its "size" instvar being
a byte.

This closes #2783

-    int result = 0;
+    long result = 0;
-    return result;
+    return (int) (result & 0xFFFFFFFF);
