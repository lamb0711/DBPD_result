GEODE-7866: Clean up geode-tcp-server module and add missing javadocs (#4791)

* GEODE-7866: Clean up geode-tcp-server module and add missing javadocs

Added package-info javadoc

Renamed ServerSocketCreatorImpl to ClusterSocketCreatorImpl and renamed
variables associated with these objects

Removed TcpServerGossipVersionDUnitTest, which was only needed in old
pre-Geode code when transitioning from GemFire 6x to GemFire 7x.

Added javadocs to classes and public methods.

Changed TcpServerProductVersionDUnitTest to use a TcpServer instead of a
Locator.  Modified the test to wait for the TcpServer to shut down after
it receives a ShutdownMessage.

* fixed error in InternalLocator.stop() that left a singleton Locator in place

* fixing unit test failure - test creates a locator with no DS
- * @since GemFire 5.7
+ * @see TcpClient#requestToServer(HostAndPort, Object, int)
+ * @see ShutdownResponse
