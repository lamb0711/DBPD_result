xerces		2.11.0 => 2.12.0

Updated some tests due to API changes. Typically this meant
converting from until() to untilAsserted().  In other cases
you aren't allowed to throw undeclared check exceptions.

Updated and corrected powermock usage in a few places.

Did not update junit-params since too many places in our
tests use the test method name for region name (and the
test method name would not have been a legal region
name).  This is an opportunity for future refactoring.

-   *        the {@code await().until(...)} will be called. E.g.,
+   *        the {@code await().untilAsserted(...)} will be called. E.g.,
-          .until(() -> assertionConsumer.accept(examiner.apply(supplier.get())));
+          .untilAsserted(() -> assertionConsumer.accept(examiner.apply(supplier.get())));
