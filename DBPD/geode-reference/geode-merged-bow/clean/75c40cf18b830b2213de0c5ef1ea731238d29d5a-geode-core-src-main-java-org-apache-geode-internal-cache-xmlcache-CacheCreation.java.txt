GEODE-5686: Remove LocalizedStrings

Fixing problems found by lgtm.com

There were a lot of logging calls that were improperly converted from
(MessageFormatString, Argument, Exception) to a form that treated the
Exception as part of the String.format() call.

There were a number of errors in format strings or number of arguments.
MessageFormat was more forgiving about this than String.format().

There were a few dangling MessageFormat specs that needed to be
converted to String.format() specs.

This closes #2757

-   * The bridge servers configured for this cache
+   * The cache servers configured for this cache
-            String.format("While starting cache server  %s", impl),
+            String.format("While starting cache server %s", impl),
-              String.format("No attributes for  %s", myId));
+              String.format("No attributes for %s", myId));
-            throw new RuntimeException(String.format("Attributes for  %s  do not match",
+            throw new RuntimeException(String.format("Attributes for %s do not match",
-              String.format("no root  %s", rootRegion.getName()));
+              String.format("no root %s", rootRegion.getName()));
