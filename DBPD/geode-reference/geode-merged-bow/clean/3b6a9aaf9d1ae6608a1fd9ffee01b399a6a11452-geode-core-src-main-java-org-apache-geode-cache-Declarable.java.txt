GEODE-4559: pass the Cache to a Declarable (#1422)

* Declarable now has a default method named "initialize(Cache, Properties)".
This allows a Declarable to know the cache that created it.
Deprecated Declarable.init(Properties).
Note that for backwards compatibility, the product calls
both these methods. Also the two Declarables that the product
implements, AutoBalancer and ReflectionBasedAutoSerializer,
implement both these methods but after the first calls subsequent
calls of init or initialize will be noops.

* initialize on ReflectionBasedAutoSerializer now call setRegionService with the cache.
init and initialize can now be called multiple times and each time the properties will
be set again. This is for backwards compatibility.

* The AutoBalancer no longer looks up the static cache.
but instead of given one by the product calling setCache
during initialization.


+   * @deprecated as of Geode 1.5 implement initialize instead.
+
+  /**
+   * Initializes a user-defined object, owned by the given cache, using the given properties.
+   * Note that any uncaught exception
+   * thrown by this method will cause the <code>Cache</code> initialization to fail.
+   * Note that if this method is implemented then the deprecated init method should not be
+   * implemented.
+   * The product will call both methods assuming that only one will have a non-default
+   * implementation.
+   *
+   * @param cache the cache that owns this declarable
+   * @param properties Contains the parameters declared in the declarative xml file.
+   *
+   * @throws IllegalArgumentException should be thrown if properties contains something unexpected.
+   *
+   * @since Geode 1.5
