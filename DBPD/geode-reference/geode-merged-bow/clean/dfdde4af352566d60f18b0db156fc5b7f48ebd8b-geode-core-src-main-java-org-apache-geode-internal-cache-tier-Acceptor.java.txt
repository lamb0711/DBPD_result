GEODE-3075: Initial refactor adding NewProtocolServerConnection

subclassing `ServerConnection`.

The new code is broken but it won't be called under normal operation,
since it's gated on a system property, "geode.feature-protobuf-protocol"

Further refactoring and feature work to come.

+  /**
+   * For the new client-server protocol, which ignores the usual handshake mechanism.

+  public static final byte CLIENT_TO_SERVER_NEW_PROTOCOL = (byte) 110;
