GEODE-8029: Delete orphaned drf files (2nd try) (#5099)

This reverts the revert of the original commit and also fixes the
originally introduced issues.

----

The OpLog initialization now delete unused drf files to prevent the
proliferation of unused records and files within the system, which
can could cause members to fail during startup while recovering
disk-stores (especially when they are isolated for gateway-senders).

- Added distributed tests.
- Delete orphaned drf files when deleting the corresponding
  crf during recovery.
-        // I don't think the drf needs to be opened. It is only used during
-        // recovery.
-        // At some point the compacter my identify that it can be deleted.
+
+        // The drf file needs to be deleted (see GEODE-8029).
+        // If compaction is not enabled, or if the compaction-threshold is never reached, there
+        // will be orphaned drf files that are not automatically deleted (unless a manual
+        // compaction is executed), in which case a later recovery might fail when the amount of
+        // deleted records is too high (805306401).
+        setHasDeletes(false);
+        deleteDRF();
