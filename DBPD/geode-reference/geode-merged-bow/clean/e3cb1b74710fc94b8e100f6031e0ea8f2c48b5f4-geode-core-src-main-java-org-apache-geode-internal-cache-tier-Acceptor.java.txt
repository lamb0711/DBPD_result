GEODE-2257 Client configured to use locator with addPoolServer fails to connect

The first byte that a client sends is a connection-type that is >= 100.
The first bytes expected by a locator are the 4 bytes of an integer
indicating the protocol version.  I've changed the locator to read
the first byte and, if it's >= 100 send a reply byte back to the client
telling it that it's trying to contact a locator using a client/server
handshake.

The client has a new reply code that the locator is now using.  If the
client sees this reply code it will throw a GemFireConfigException.  Some
of these exceptions will be thrown in the background and get logged but
the thread initiating cache creation will also get this exception when
it invokes ClientCacheFactory.create().

The client-side error message will be in this form:
_Improperly configured client detected. Server at 10.154.30.28 is actually
a locator.  Use addPoolLocator to configure locators_.

The locator will also log a warning in this form so that alerts will be
raised:
_Unable to process request from 10.118.33.195 exception=Improperly
configured client detected - use addPoolLocator to configure its
locators instead of addPoolServer_.

+  // The following are communications "mode" bytes sent as the first byte of a
+  // client/server handshake. They must not be larger than 1 byte
