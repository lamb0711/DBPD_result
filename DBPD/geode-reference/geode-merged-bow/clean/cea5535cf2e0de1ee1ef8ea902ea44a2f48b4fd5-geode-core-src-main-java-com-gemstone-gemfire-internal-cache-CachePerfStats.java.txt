GEODE-1761 Clients don't fail back when servers are bounced

Servers will send a refresh hint to clients if they detect that a request
had to be send to a different server who owned the primary bucket
affected by the operation.  Clients should always refresh when this
happens unless they have connection-pool size constraints that force
them to use non-optimal servers.

Client-side operation classes have been modified to initiate the refresh.
I've added code in the meta-data service class to avoid performing
multiple concurrent refreshes on the same region.

On the server-side I've cleaned up some of the network-hop detection
code to stop using hard-coded integers and to consolidate some of
the code that resets the ThreadLocals being used to record network-
hops detected.

-    final String metaDataRefreshCountDesc = "Total number of times the meta data is refreshed due to hopping obsevred.";
+    final String metaDataRefreshCountDesc = "Total number of times the meta data is refreshed due to hopping observed.";
