GEODE-986 MultiuserAPIDUnitTest.testMultiUserUnsupportedAPIs failed with SocketException

Reactivated the TcpServer backward-compatibility test.  This test failed if
TcpClient thought that the locator was running 5.7 (I hand-sabotaged the
code to make it think the locator was 5.7) but it passes with 9a .0 fallback
default.
