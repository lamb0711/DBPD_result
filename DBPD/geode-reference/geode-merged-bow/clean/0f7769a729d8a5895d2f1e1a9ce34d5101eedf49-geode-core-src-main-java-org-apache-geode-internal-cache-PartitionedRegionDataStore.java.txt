GEODE-5888: Only the thread locked objects can release/remove them (#2645)

 * A bulk opertion could remove lockObject due to RegionDestroyedException.
 * Now only the thread locked objects can release them.
 * Rename activeWriteLock to be primaryMoveReadLock as it is a readLock.

-      Lock writeLock = bucketAdvisor.getActiveWriteLock();
+      Lock primaryMoveReadLock = bucketAdvisor.getPrimaryMoveReadLock();
-      writeLock.lock();
+      primaryMoveReadLock.lock();
-        writeLock.unlock();
+        primaryMoveReadLock.unlock();
