GEODE-4833: JdbcWriter and JdbcAsyncWriter may fail to write null fields to database (#1636)

Null values are now supported. Meta-data read from the database is now used to determine the
column type and used to call setNull.

* Renamed TableKeyColumnManager to TableMetaDataManager
* registerPdxMetaData will now throw an exception if the instance is not serialized with PDX

+   * Note that this method serializes the given instance so PDX must already be configured
+   * to do the serialization.
+   * <p>
-   * @throws SerializationException if the instance can not be serialized
+   * @throws SerializationException if the instance can not be serialized or is not serialized with
+   *         PDX
