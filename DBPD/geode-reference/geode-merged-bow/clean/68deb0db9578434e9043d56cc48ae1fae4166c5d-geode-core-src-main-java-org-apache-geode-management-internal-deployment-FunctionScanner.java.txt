GEODE-800: Update fast-classpath-scanner to 2.18.1 (#1430)

- This also fixes the issue of picking up nested resources
- The new fast-classpath-scanner runs slower than the prior version. This isn't
  a problem for general use, but some tests have been adjusted to take this
  into account.
-    FastClasspathScanner fastClasspathScanner = new FastClasspathScanner()
+    FastClasspathScanner fastClasspathScanner = new FastClasspathScanner("-dir:")
