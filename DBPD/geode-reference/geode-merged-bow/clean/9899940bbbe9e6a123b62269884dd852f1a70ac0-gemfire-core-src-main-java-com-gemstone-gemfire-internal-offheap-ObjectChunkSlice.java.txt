GEODE-831: unit test FreeListManager

* moved state from SimpleMemoryAllocatorImpl to FreeListManager
* refactored and cleaned up release/free code
* Removed ChunkType and ChunkFactory. They were no longer used by GemFire and complicated the code
* removed BATCH_SIZE; it was an expirement that was not longer used
* combined Chunk and GemFireChunk to the new ObjectChunk class

- * Represents a slice of a GemFireChunk.
- * A slice is a subsequence of the bytes stored in a GemFireChunk.
+ * Represents a slice of an ObjectChunk.
+ * A slice is a subsequence of the bytes stored in an ObjectChunk.
