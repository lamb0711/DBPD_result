GEODE-7535: Prevent exception throw during getAll (#4415)

Added a try-catch block during basicGetAll to avoid throwing
EntryDestroyedException whenever the value is locally destroyed as a result
of another concurrent region operation (like eviction/expiration).
The  operation will try to retrieve the value from the server as it
regularly does for any entry that doesn't exist locally.

- Fixed minor warnings.
- Added unit and distributed tests.
-          Object key = iterator.next();
+          Object key = iterator.next();
-          if (entry != null && (value = entry.getValue()) != null) {
-            allResults.put(key, value);
-            iterator.remove();
+
+          try {
+            if (entry != null && (value = entry.getValue()) != null) {
+              allResults.put(key, value);
+              iterator.remove();
+            }
+          } catch (EntryDestroyedException ignored) {
+            // The entry might have been removed locally between first and second fetch.
+            // If that's the case, don't remove the key and try to retrieve the value from server.
