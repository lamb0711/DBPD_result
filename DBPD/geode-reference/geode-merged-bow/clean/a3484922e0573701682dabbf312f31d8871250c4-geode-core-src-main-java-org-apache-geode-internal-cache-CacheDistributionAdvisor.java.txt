GEODE-3557: remove calls to GemFireCacheImpl getInstance

The DM now remembers the InternalCache that created it.
Changed places that had a dm to use its getCache method
instead of GemFireCacheImpl getInstance.

-                PartitionedRegionHelper.getProxyBucketRegion(GemFireCacheImpl.getInstance(),
-                    adviseePath, false),
+                PartitionedRegionHelper.getProxyBucketRegion(dm.getCache(), adviseePath, false),
