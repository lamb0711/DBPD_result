GEODE-1755 Clean up TODOs in membership, communications and serialization components

- *   TODO this is a version of PooledExecutorWithDMStats that was spun off
- *   in cedar_dev_Oct12 as a measure to fix bug #46438.  It should be cleaned
- *   up to not have code paths for !forFnExecution since it is only used
- *   for function execution.  This was not done for the 8.0 release because
- *   of code freeze.
