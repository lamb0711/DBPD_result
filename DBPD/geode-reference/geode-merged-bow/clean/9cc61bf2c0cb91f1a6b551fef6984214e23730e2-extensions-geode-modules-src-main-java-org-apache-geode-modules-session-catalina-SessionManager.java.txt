GEODE-8217: Deserialize attribute before update and remove. (#5256)

When preferDeserializedForm is true we deserialize the previous attributes before update or remove.

Deprecates preferDeserializedForm since when false it's unclear when you will get serialized or unserialized forms of attributes.

+  /**
+   * @deprecated no replacement. Always prefer deserialized form.
+   */
+  @Deprecated
