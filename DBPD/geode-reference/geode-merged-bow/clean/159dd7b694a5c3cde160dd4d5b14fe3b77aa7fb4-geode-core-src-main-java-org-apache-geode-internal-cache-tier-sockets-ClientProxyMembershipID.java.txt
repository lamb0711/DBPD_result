GEODE-6883 Move the membership code into a separate gradle sub-project

This commit is focused on removing references to
InternalDistributedMember and DistributionMessage from "gms"
packages.

    GMS classes only refer to GMSMember
    GMS classes use GMSMembershipView.  NetView is now an interface
    GMS classes do not refer to DistributionMessage.  JGroupsMessenger
      expects GMSMessage instances.  Geode messages to be sent over UDP
      are wrapped in a GMSMessageAdapter.
    "gms" messages extend AbstractGMSMessage which implements GMSMessage
    GMSMembershipManager has an inner class that implements the GMS Manager
      interface and is now in the "adapter" package
    GMSMembershipManager translates GMSMembershipView into a MembershipView
      for the rest of Geode to use (this is the old NetView class)
    GMS instantiation allows us to inject the Manager into the new Services
      instance.
    Other adapter classes have been added to translate between Geode
      and GMS.

    GMSUtil has new methods for marshalling/unmarshalling
    InternalDistributedMember instances for backward-compatibility.
    GMSMember now has the same on-wire form as
    InternalDistributedMember.  This allows the GMS classes to
    deserialize a message from a pre-1.10 member whose code writes
    InternalDistributedMembers when serializing something like a
    JoinRequest.

-    DurableClientAttributes dca = getDurableAttributes();
-    if (dca != null) {
-      dca.updateTimeout(newValue);
-    }
+    InternalDistributedMember member = (InternalDistributedMember) getDistributedMember();
+    member.getNetMember().setDurableTimeout(newValue);
