GEODE-1981: Wrapping user ResultCollector in synchronized wrapper

When executing a function from a client, we can be adding results to the
result collector from multiple threads. Our docs claim the user should
not have to synchronize their result collector. One code path was already
synchronizing on the collector when adding results. However, if the
function returned an exception we were not synchronizing.

Adding a SynchronizedResultCollector and wrapping the users collector in
that to ensure that there will be no unsynchronized access of the result
collector.

+import org.apache.geode.internal.cache.execute.util.SynchronizedResultCollector;
-    this.rc = rc;
+    this.rc = rc != null ? new SynchronizedResultCollector(rc) : null;
