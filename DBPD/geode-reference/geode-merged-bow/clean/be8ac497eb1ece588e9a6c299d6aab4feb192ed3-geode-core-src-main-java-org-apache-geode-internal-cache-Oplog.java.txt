GEODE-8029: Delete orphaned drf files (#5037)

The OpLog initialization now delete unused drf files to prevent the
proliferation of unused records and files within the system, which
can could cause members to fail during startup while recovering
disk-stores (especially when they are isolated for gateway-senders).

- Added distributed tests.
- Delete orphaned drf files when deleting the corresponding
  crf during recovery.
-        // I don't think the drf needs to be opened. It is only used during
-        // recovery.
-        // At some point the compacter my identify that it can be deleted.
+
+        // See GEODE-8029.
+        // The drf file needs to be deleted, especially when the disk-store is *only* used by
+        // gateway-senders, otherwise there will be orphaned drfs that are never deleted by
+        // compaction (unless there are pending events in the queue upon restart, aka there's a crf,
+        // or a manual compaction is executed).
+        deleteDRF();
