GEODE-4308: Allow two caches in the same JVM if a feature flag is on

If the system property gemfire.ALLOW_MULTIPLE_SYSTEMS is set, then we will
allow multiple caches in the same JVM. Otherwise, the we will have the
same behavior as before.

If the system property is set, we will not retain any static instance of
the cache or distributed system.

Removed the static instance variables from GemFireCacheImpl.
GemFireCacheImpl.getInstance calls now look up the cache instance from
the distributed system.

Note that a single distributed system can still only have a single
cache. Users should create caches and distributed systems using
CacheFactory.create.

-  private static Thread statThread = null;
+  private Thread statThread = null;
