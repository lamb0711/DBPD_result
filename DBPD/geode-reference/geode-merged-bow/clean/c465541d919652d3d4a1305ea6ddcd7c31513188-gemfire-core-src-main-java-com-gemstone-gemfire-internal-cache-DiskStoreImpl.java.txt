GEODE-601: Fix intermittent exception in DiskRegionJUnitTest.

An expected DiskAccessException causes the cache to close
asynchronously. That leads to a race condition during test tearDown,
between checking that the cache is closed and it's access. Now wait
for the cache to close before tearDown.
Refactors:
 Moved putSuccessful and exceptionOccurred inside Puts
 Remove unnecessary thread creation for Puts in DiskRegionJUnitTest
 Expose _testHandleDiskAccessException through method

This closes #72

-  final CountDownLatch _testHandleDiskAccessException = new CountDownLatch(1);
+  private final CountDownLatch _testHandleDiskAccessException = new CountDownLatch(1);
-  void waitForClose() {
+  protected void waitForClose() {
