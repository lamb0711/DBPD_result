GEODE-6285: Make MBean names immutable in loner

Introduce new DistributedMember.getUniqueId which is immutable.

Change MBeanJMXAdapter to use getUniqueId for MBean names
instead of getId when a member name has not been specified.

+  /**
+   * Return a unique string id for this member which is immutable and will not change during the
+   * life of this member.
+   */
+  String getUniqueId();
