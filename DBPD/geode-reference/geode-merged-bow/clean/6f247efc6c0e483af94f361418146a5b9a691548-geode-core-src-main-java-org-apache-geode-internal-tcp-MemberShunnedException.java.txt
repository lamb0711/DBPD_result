GEODE-7479: Change Membership interface to use MemberIdentifier interface (#4420)

Changing all classes in Membership to be parameterized by an ID type,
which extends MemberIdentifier. This allows core to create a membership
system that manages InternalDistributedMember objects in a type safe
way.

Removing all uses of InternalDistributedMember, DistributedMember, and
friends from within the membership code.

-import org.apache.geode.distributed.DistributedMember;
-  private DistributedMember member;
-   * @param member the member that was shunned
-  public MemberShunnedException(DistributedMember member) {
+  public MemberShunnedException() {
-    this.member = member;
-  }
-
-  /**
-   * @return the member that was shunned
-   */
-  public DistributedMember getShunnedMember() {
-    return this.member;
