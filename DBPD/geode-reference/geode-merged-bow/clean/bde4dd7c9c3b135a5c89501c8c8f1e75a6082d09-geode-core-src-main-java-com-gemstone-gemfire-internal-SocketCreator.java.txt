GEODE-980: The member's local hostname is just an IP address

- Trouble on Mac OS is that the hostname is not tied to a particular
  address like other *nix systems. A typical *nix system might have the
  hostname defined in /etc/hosts or resolvable via DNS. The hostname/IP
  mapping remains fixed and consistent. Under Mac OS (and at least under
  Java) the InetAddress.getLocalHost call is not deterministic and may
  associate the local hostname with any of the hosts' currently assigned
  IP addresses. There is no mapping done through /etc/hosts. This also
  means that given a localhost InetAddress, a reverse DNS lookup of the
  address will fail.
- By using only the IP address for the local hostname, the member ID
  remains consistent.

-      lh = InetAddress.getLocalHost();
+      lh = InetAddress.getByAddress(InetAddress.getLocalHost().getAddress());
