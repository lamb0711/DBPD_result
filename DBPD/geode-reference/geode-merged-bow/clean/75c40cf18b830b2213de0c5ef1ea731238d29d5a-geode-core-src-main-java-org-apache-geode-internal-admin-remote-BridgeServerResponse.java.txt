GEODE-5686: Remove LocalizedStrings

Fixing problems found by lgtm.com

There were a lot of logging calls that were improperly converted from
(MessageFormatString, Argument, Exception) to a form that treated the
Exception as part of the String.format() call.

There were a number of errors in format strings or number of arguments.
MessageFormat was more forgiving about this than String.format().

There were a few dangling MessageFormat specs that needed to be
converted to String.format() specs.

This closes #2757

- * a bridge server and returns the result to the sender.
+ * a cache server and returns the result to the sender.
-  /** Information about the bridge server that was operated on */
+  /** Information about the cache server that was operated on */
-            Assert.assertTrue(false, "Unknown bridge server operation: " + operation);
+            Assert.assertTrue(false, "Unknown cache server operation: " + operation);
