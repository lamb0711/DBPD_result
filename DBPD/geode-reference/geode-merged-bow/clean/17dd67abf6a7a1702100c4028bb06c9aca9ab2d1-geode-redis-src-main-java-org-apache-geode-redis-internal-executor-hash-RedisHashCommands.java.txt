* changed all String commands to use the function and to use a single region
* renabled tests ignored for GEODE-8182
* removed the RedisLockService since it is not used in the new data model
* removed the unused del methods on RedisSetCommands and RedisHashCommands
* removed the KeyRegistar since it was no longer needed with a single data region
