GEODE-243: remove deprecated Bridge feature

All the public classes and most of the internal ones
have been removed. The cache xsd also has its bridge
elements removed.
The deprecated admin package did not have its bridge
apis removed since the entire admin package is going
to be removed as a seperate project.
The external javadocs have also been updated to no
longer use the term "bridge".
Localized strings were changed to no longer use "bridge".
Internal code and test code continues to have some
bridge references. Additional cleanup will be done
in the future.

-import com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.util.BridgeClient;
-    if (cacheLoader instanceof BridgeClient && !hasCacheWriter()) {
-      // fix for bug 36247
-      setCacheWriter((BridgeClient)cacheLoader);
-    }
-    if (cacheWriter instanceof BridgeClient && !hasCacheLoader()) {
-      // fix for bug 36247
-      setCacheLoader((BridgeClient)cacheWriter);
-    }
