GEODE-6272: change jdbc to use pdx as keys instead of json (#3076)

Composite keys for the jdbc connector must now be PdxInstances created with "neverDeserialize".

* added PdxInstanceFactory.neverDeserialize and PdxInstance.isDeserializable as new external APIs.

* improved the InternalPdxInstance interface to include Sendable.
Also this interface is now implemented by the pdx enum classes.
So now all classes that implement PdxInstance also implement InternalPdxInstance

* getCacheObject is now on the InternalPdxInstance interface.

* getRawField is now in the InternalPdxInstance interface.
A method that was on PdxInstanceImpl but only used by AttributeDescriptor
and that did not use any PdxInstanceImpl data is now on AttributeDescriptor.
This also got rid of a singleton lookup of the cache.

* removed unused FieldNotFoundInPdxVersion

* removed PdxFieldNotFoundException

+
+  /**
+   * The instance created by this factory will be one that is never
+   * deserialized to a domain class. It will always be a PdxInstance.
+   *
+   * @return this PdxInstanceFactory
+   * @since Geode 1.9
+   */
+  PdxInstanceFactory neverDeserialize();
