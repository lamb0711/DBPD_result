GEODE-7655:Restore context with distinct state after a recursion step.

	* After a recursion step within Compiled Select's evaluate statement, the distinct flag was lost for the outer query.
	* The solution was to reset the distinct state back using a temp variable to store the initial distinct flag value.
	* Also, in this diff a else part section was missing converting PDX strings to normal strings for comparison of distinct.
	* When we place this else section converting the PDX string to string for distinct comparison, we don't need to perform this check in the 'element' query function.
