GEODE-1755 Clean up TODOs in membership, communications and serialization components

-    // TODO: because startTime uses getTimeStamp replyMessageTime
-    // ends up measuring both messageProcessingScheduleTime and
-    // processedMessagesTime. I'm not sure this was intended.
-    // I've added this info to the stat description so update it
-    // if the startTime changes.
