GEODE-539: remove XD off-heap artifacts

The OffHeapReference interface has been removed.
Use the StoredObject interface instead.

The XD SRC_TYPE constants have been renamed to
unused and a comment added explaining why we might
want to keep the SRC_TYPE/ChunkType feature around
for future off-heap extensions.
