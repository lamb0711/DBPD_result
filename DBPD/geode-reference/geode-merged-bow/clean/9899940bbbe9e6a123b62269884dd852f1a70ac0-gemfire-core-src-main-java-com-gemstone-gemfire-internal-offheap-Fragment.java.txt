GEODE-831: unit test FreeListManager

* moved state from SimpleMemoryAllocatorImpl to FreeListManager
* refactored and cleaned up release/free code
* Removed ChunkType and ChunkFactory. They were no longer used by GemFire and complicated the code
* removed BATCH_SIZE; it was an expirement that was not longer used
* combined Chunk and GemFireChunk to the new ObjectChunk class

-  private static final byte FILL_BYTE = Chunk.FILL_BYTE;
+  private static final byte FILL_BYTE = ObjectChunk.FILL_BYTE;
-  public ChunkType getChunkType() {
-    return null;
-  }
-  
-  @Override
+  @Override
+  public String toString() {
+    return "Fragment [baseAddr=" + baseAddr + ", size=" + size + ", freeIdx=" + freeIdx + "]";
+  }
