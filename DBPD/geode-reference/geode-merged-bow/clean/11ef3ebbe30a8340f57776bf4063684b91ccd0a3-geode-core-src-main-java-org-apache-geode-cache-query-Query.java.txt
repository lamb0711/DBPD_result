GEODE-538: Add check for persistent data recovery

PartitionedRegion.getNodeForBucketReadOrLoad can return an invalid node
if persistent data recovery is in process and a get() targets a bucket
that
hasn't been recoverd yet. This can result in returning an incorrect
value (null) or throwing ConflictingPersistentDataException from a get()
or put() on the region.

This change adds a check for persistent recovery to be completed
before creating the new bucket. If recovery isn't complete then the
operation on the region will fail with a PartitionOfflineException.

Queries on a region while persistent recovery is in progress can also
result in incorrect results so a similar check is added to
DefaultQuery.checkQueryOnPR.

This closes #264
