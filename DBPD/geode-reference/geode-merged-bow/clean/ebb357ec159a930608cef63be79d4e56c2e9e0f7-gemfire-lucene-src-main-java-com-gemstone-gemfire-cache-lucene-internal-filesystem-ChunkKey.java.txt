Adding a couple of simple junit tests for FileSystem

Testing some basic file write and read operations, as well as file
renames and deletes.

I also added some more javadocs to the filesystem classes and moved them
into a separate package.

-package com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.lucene.internal;
+package com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.lucene.internal.filesystem;
+/**
+ * The key for a single chunk on a file stored within a region.
+ */
