GEODE-4791: Fix intellij with gradle 4.8 by removing provided configuration

Replacing provided configuration with gradles compileOnly configuration

Also Fixing geode-pulse with initellij. Pulse was using a couple of dependencies 
that we were including transitively. Unfortunately, they were being included 
transitively by multiple dependencies, some of which were runtime and some 
compile. 

Removing circular dependency with geode-junit and geode-old-versions
