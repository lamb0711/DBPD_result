GEODE-77 fixed a problem with creating member IDs for a test

+import com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.SocketCreator;
-   * Return a new NetMember representing current host
+   * Return a new NetMember representing current host.  This
+   * is used for testing, so we ignore host-name lookup
+   * localhost inetAddress
-   * @param s a String referring to the current host
+   * @param s a String referring to a host - ignored
-      inetAddr=InetAddress.getByName(s);
-    } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
-      throw new RuntimeException("Unable to create an identifier for testing for " + s, e);
+      inetAddr=SocketCreator.getLocalHost();
+    } catch (UnknownHostException e2) {
+      throw new RuntimeException("Unable to create an identifier for testing for " + s, e2);
