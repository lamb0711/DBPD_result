Removing TCPConduit's Stub ID class

This removes the Stub identifier class from TCPConduit.  This simplifies the
code since the DistributedMember IDs are propagated to all of the methods
that require identifiers and these IDs have all of the information Stubs
had.

The MembershipManager is also simplified since it doesn't have to keep
complicated mappings between Stubs and DistributedMembers.

-  public static final StringId TCPConduit_EXCEPTION_CREATING_SERVERSOCKET = new StringId(2089, "While creating ServerSocket and Stub on port {0} with address {1}");
+  public static final StringId TCPConduit_EXCEPTION_CREATING_SERVERSOCKET = new StringId(2089, "While creating ServerSocket on port {0} with address {1}");
-  public static final StringId Connection_MEMBER_FOR_STUB_0_LEFT_THE_GROUP = new StringId(2435, "Member for stub  {0}  left the group");
+  public static final StringId Connection_MEMBER_LEFT_THE_GROUP = new StringId(2435, "Member {0}  left the group");
-  public static final StringId DirectChannel_NO_STUB_0 = new StringId(2533, "No stub {0}");
+  public static final StringId DirectChannel_SHUNNING_0 = new StringId(2533, "Member is being shunned: {0}");
