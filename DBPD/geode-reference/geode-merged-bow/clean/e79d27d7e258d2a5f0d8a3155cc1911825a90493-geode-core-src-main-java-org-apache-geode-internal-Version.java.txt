GEODE-2954 Old client gets null memberID in cache listener

I've added a new test that demonstrates that a new-version server sends
an EventID to a client that the client is unable to deserialize
completely.  It gets an error when deserializing its member ID,
causing cache listeners to get a null when requesting the ID of
the member that effected the change.

The fix is to reserialize the member ID in EventID.toData if the
destination stream is for an older version, such as a 1.1.0 client.
This ensures the proper on-wire format is used for that version of Geode.

I've also bumped up the version ordinal for 1.2 since version 59 is
marked as unusable in Version.java.

I've changed the Banner to show the version ordinal because the other
version information in the banner isn't completely trustworthy.  It
looks for a GemFireVersion.properties file on the classpath to get
this information and so it may not get it from the Geode jar file
as expected.

-  public static final int HIGHEST_VERSION = 60;
+  public static final int HIGHEST_VERSION = 65;
-  private static final byte GEODE_120_ORDINAL = 60;
+  private static final byte GEODE_120_ORDINAL = 65;
