GEODE-580: cleanup off-heap code

Unused dead code and classes have been removed.
The following inner classes have been moved to their own class files:
LifeCycleListener, Chunk, ChunkFactory, GemFireChunkFactory,
GemFireChunk, GemFireChunkSlice, ChunkWithHeapForm,
DataAsAddress, Fragment, RefCountChangeInfo, MemoryBlockNode,
SyncChunkStack, and FreeListManager.

The reference count debugging code has all been moved
to a new class named ReferenceCountHelper.

-      SimpleMemoryAllocatorImpl.skipRefCountTracking();
+      ReferenceCountHelper.skipRefCountTracking();
-      SimpleMemoryAllocatorImpl.unskipRefCountTracking();
+      ReferenceCountHelper.unskipRefCountTracking();
-      SimpleMemoryAllocatorImpl.setReferenceCountOwner(owner);
+      ReferenceCountHelper.setReferenceCountOwner(owner);
-      SimpleMemoryAllocatorImpl.setReferenceCountOwner(null);
+      ReferenceCountHelper.setReferenceCountOwner(null);
