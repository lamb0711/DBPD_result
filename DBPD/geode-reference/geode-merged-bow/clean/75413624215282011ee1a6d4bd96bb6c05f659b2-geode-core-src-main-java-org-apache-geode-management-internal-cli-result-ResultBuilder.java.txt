GEODE-5206: Add an 'ignoreFailure' flag to CliFunctionResult (#1957)

- The intention of this is to avoid needing to pass 'skip-if-exists' or
  'if-not-exists' flags to any command function. The function should set this
  flag if it determines that the construct it is dealing with either already
  exists or does not exist depending on the action. The calling command will
  then be able to use this information do display and set status appropriately.
- Collapse the state of successful and ignoreable into a single enum - OK,
  ERROR or IGNORED.
-      tabularData.accumulate("Status", result.getStatus());
+      tabularData.accumulate("Status", result.getLegacyStatus());
