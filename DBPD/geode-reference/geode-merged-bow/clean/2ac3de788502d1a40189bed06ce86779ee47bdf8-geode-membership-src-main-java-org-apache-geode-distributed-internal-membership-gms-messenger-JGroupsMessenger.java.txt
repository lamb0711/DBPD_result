GEODE-7921: NullPointerExceptions logged during auto-reconnect (#4898)

Don't deliver cache-level messages that were queued while disconnected
for auto-reconnect.  During auto-reconnect there is a QuorumChecker that
receives messages on the jgroups channel and tries to establish
communications with a quorum of the old membership view.  It may also
get JoinRequest messages and other membership-level messages but I
observed one case where it also queued cache-level messages when the
property disable-tcp was set to true (funnelling all comms through
jgroups).

I also added some null checks to the LatestLastAccessTimeMessage and a
small test for that.
+import org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.membership.gms.interfaces.Manager;
-  private JGroupsReceiver jgroupsReceiver;
+  protected JGroupsReceiver jgroupsReceiver;
-    private void receive(org.jgroups.Message jgmsg, boolean fromQuorumChecker) {
+    protected void receive(org.jgroups.Message jgmsg, boolean fromQuorumChecker) {
-          if (fromQuorumChecker && handler instanceof HealthMonitor) {
+          if (fromQuorumChecker
+              && (handler instanceof HealthMonitor || handler instanceof Manager)) {
-            // auto-reconnect because they very likely have old member IDs in them
+            // auto-reconnect because they very likely have old member IDs in them.
+            // Also ignore non-membership messages because we weren't a member when we received
+            // them.
