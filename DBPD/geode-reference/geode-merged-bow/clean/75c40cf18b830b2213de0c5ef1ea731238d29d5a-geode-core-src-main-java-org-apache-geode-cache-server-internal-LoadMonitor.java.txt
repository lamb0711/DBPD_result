GEODE-5686: Remove LocalizedStrings

Fixing problems found by lgtm.com

There were a lot of logging calls that were improperly converted from
(MessageFormatString, Argument, Exception) to a form that treated the
Exception as part of the String.format() call.

There were a number of errors in format strings or number of arguments.
MessageFormat was more forgiving about this than String.format().

There were a few dangling MessageFormat specs that needed to be
converted to String.format() specs.

This closes #2757

- * A class which monitors the load on a bridge server and periodically sends updates to the locator.
+ * A class which monitors the load on a cache server and periodically sends updates to the locator.
-              logger.debug("Bridge Server Load Monitor Transmitting load {} to locators {}", load,
+              logger.debug("cache server Load Monitor Transmitting load {} to locators {}", load,
-                  "Bridge Server Load Monitor Load {} hasn't changed, not transmitting. skippedLoadUpdates={}",
+                  "cache server Load Monitor Load {} hasn't changed, not transmitting. skippedLoadUpdates={}",
