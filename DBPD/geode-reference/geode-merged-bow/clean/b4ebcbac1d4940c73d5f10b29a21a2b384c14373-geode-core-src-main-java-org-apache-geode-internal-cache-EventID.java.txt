GEODE-3153 Client receives duplicate events during rolling upgrade

The previous fix worked fine for 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 clients but there are
old GemFire 8.2 clients still in use that the fix did not work for.
This patch changes the serialization to always send UUID bytes to pre
Version.GFE_90 (1.0.0-incubating) clients.

Added unit for it

-   * memberID bytes and use that version to deserialize the bytes
+   * memberID bytes and use that version to deserialize the bytes. Clients prior to 1.1.0 need to
+   * have UUID bytes in the memberID. Newer clients don't require this.
-  private InternalDistributedMember getDistributedMember(Version targetVersion) {
+  public InternalDistributedMember getDistributedMember(Version targetVersion) {
-    if (0 <= targetVersion.compareTo(Version.GFE_90)
-        && targetVersion.compareTo(Version.GEODE_110) < 0) {
+    if (targetVersion.compareTo(Version.GEODE_110) < 0) {
-      InternalDistributedMember member = getDistributedMember(version);
+      InternalDistributedMember member = getDistributedMember(Version.GFE_90);
-      HeapDataOutputStream hdos = new HeapDataOutputStream(version);
+      HeapDataOutputStream hdos = new HeapDataOutputStream(Version.GFE_90);
