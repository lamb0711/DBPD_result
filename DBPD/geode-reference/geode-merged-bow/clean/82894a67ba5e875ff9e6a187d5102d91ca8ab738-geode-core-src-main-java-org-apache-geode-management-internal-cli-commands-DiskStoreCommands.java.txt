GEODE-2986: Remove redundant log message

Just log message if "notExecutedMembers" is not null and not empty.

This closes #535

-            LogWrapper.getInstance()
-                .info("compact disk-store \"" + diskStoreName
-                    + "\" message was scheduled to be sent to but was not send to "
-                    + notExecutedMembers);
+            if (notExecutedMembers != null && !notExecutedMembers.isEmpty()) {
+              LogWrapper.getInstance()
+                  .info("compact disk-store \"" + diskStoreName
+                      + "\" message was scheduled to be sent to but was not send to "
+                      + notExecutedMembers);
+            }
