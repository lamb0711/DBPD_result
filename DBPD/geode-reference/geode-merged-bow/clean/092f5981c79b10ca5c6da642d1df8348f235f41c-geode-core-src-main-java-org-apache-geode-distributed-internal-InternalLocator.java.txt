GEODE-6384: Create consistent API to retrieve instances of ClusterManagementService (#3191)


- The overall intent of this commit is to provide a consistent means for
  retrieving a ClusterMangementService instance regardless of the
  context you are developing in. Currently, the relevant contexts are:
  1) a Java application that has no access (or need to access) core
  Geode code. 2) a typical Geode client application and 3) server or
  locator-side code.
- Introduces a service provider interface
  (ClusterManagementServiceProviderFactory) whose implementations are
  context dependent. This commit introduces two implementations, namely:
  BasicClusterManagementProviderFactory and
  SmartClusterManagementServiceProviderFactory). The latter is
  incomplete but will be fully supported in the near future.
- The entry point to creating a ClusterManagementService is in
  ClusterManagementServiceProvider - more documentation can be found
  there.
