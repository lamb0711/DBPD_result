GEODE-1800 StoppableCondition has faulty code in await()

The faulty methods in StoppableCondition have been removed.  I considered
removing StoppableCondition entirely and just using a Condition on the lock
wrapped by the Stoppable lock class but doing so would require additional work
to make the CancelCriterion available to the code that uses these
StoppableConditions, so other than removing the methods I've left the class
alone.

-                regionToDispatchedKeysMapEmpty.await();
+                regionToDispatchedKeysMapEmpty.await(StoppableCondition.TIME_TO_WAIT);
