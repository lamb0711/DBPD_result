Changing IndexManager to take a RegionFunctionContext

The LuceneSearchFunctionArgs class had a getBuckets method, but it

Change the API to pass the function context to the RepositoryManager.

-   * @return List of bucket IDs on which the query is to be executed
-   */
-  public Set<Integer> getBuckets() {
-    return null;
-  }
