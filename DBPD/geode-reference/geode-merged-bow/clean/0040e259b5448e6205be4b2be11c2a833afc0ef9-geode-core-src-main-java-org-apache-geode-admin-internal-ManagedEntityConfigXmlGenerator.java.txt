GEODE-3583: Marking static variables final that are never modified

To help reduce the number of mutable statics to look through, adding
final to all of the statics that are not actually mutated outside of a
static initializer.

This change *only* consists of adding final to these variables.

-  private static Attributes EMPTY = new AttributesImpl();
+  private static final Attributes EMPTY = new AttributesImpl();
