+  private final InternalDistributedSystem ds;
-  public ConnectionImpl(DistributedSystem ds, CancelCriterion cancelCriterion) {
+  public ConnectionImpl(InternalDistributedSystem ds, CancelCriterion cancelCriterion) {
-    DistributionConfig config = InternalDistributedSystem.getConnectedInstance().getConfig();
+    DistributionConfig config = ds.getConfig();
