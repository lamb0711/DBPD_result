GEODE-3147: Set commBuffer for threads performing TXSynchronization calls when max-threads is set.

	Added an interface that is implemented by AcceptorImpl to set and release commBuffer.

	Added a unit test case that failed without this fix.

-          TXSynchronizationRunnable sync = new TXSynchronizationRunnable(beforeCompletion);
+          TXSynchronizationRunnable sync =
+              new TXSynchronizationRunnable(beforeCompletion, serverConnection.getAcceptor());
