GEODE-77: faster initiation of suspect processing on crashed member
TCPConduit's Connection.java was not initiating suspect processing when a member crashed.  This was due to not having the check in the normal (amt < 0) check for a socket error.

In testing this fix with ReconnectDUnitTest I found that the change exposed some problems in GMSJoinLeave that were keeping reconnect from happening as fast as it should:

1. The reconnecting member was processing a RemoveMember message intended for its old incarnation.  This caused it to invoke forceDisconnect() but the concurrent join() attempt did not notice this and continued to try to connect until it timed out.

2. ViewCreator was removing the new member from the view if its old ID was being declared crashed in the same view because of the way InternalDistributedMember.compareTo() works with viewless identifiers.

This change-set also gets rid of a bunch of references to JGroups scattered around in the code and removes references to JGroups classes from GMSMembershipManager, moving the code requiring these refs to the quorum checker.

-              if(canonicalMembers.containsKey(versionTag.getMemberID())) {
-                versionTag.setMemberID(canonicalMembers.get(versionTag.getMemberID()));
-              } else {
-                canonicalMembers.put(versionTag.getMemberID(), versionTag.getMemberID());
+              VersionSource id = versionTag.getMemberID();
+              if (id != null) {
+                if(canonicalMembers.containsKey(id)) {
+                  versionTag.setMemberID(canonicalMembers.get(id));
+                } else {
+                  canonicalMembers.put(id, id);
+                }
