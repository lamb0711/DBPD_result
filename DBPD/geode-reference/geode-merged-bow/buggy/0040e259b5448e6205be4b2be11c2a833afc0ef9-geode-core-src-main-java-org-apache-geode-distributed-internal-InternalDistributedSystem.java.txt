GEODE-3583: Marking static variables final that are never modified

To help reduce the number of mutable statics to look through, adding
final to all of the statics that are not actually mutated outside of a
static initializer.

This change *only* consists of adding final to these variables.

-  private static Set connectListeners = new LinkedHashSet(); // needs to be ordered
+  private static final Set connectListeners = new LinkedHashSet(); // needs to be ordered
-  private static List<ReconnectListener> reconnectListeners = new ArrayList<>();
+  private static final List<ReconnectListener> reconnectListeners = new ArrayList<>();
