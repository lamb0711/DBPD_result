GEODE-3153 Client receives duplicate events during rolling upgrade

Another problem was found in backward-compatibility testing.  If a
1.0.0 client was receiving subscription events generated by a 1.0.0
peer "feeder" member and the events were routed through a 1.0.0 server
the client might see duplicate events when the server is stopped and
the client fails over to a 1.2.0 server holding its redundant
subscription queue.  This is especially possible if a large "ack"
period is established in the client.

The problem stems from the EventID deserialization/reserialization of
the memberID bytes when sending to a 1.0 client.  It was deserializing
using Version.CURRENT, which ignores the UUID bytes in the serialized ID.
Then it serialized the identifier using the client's version, which
includes the UUID bytes but which are zero due to the version used
in deserialization.

+import org.apache.geode.internal.VersionedDataInputStream;
+    return getDistributedMember(Version.CURRENT);
+  }
+
+  /**
+   * deserialize the memberID bytes using the given version. The correct thing to do would be to
+   * have EventID carry the version ordinal of the serialized memberID, or to have it be part of the
+   * memberID bytes and use that version to deserialize the bytes
+   */
+  private InternalDistributedMember getDistributedMember(Version targetVersion) {
+    if (0 <= targetVersion.compareTo(Version.GFE_90)
+        && targetVersion.compareTo(Version.GEODE_110) < 0) {
+      // GEODE-3153: clients expect to receive UUID bytes, which are only
+      // read if the stream's version is 1.0.0-incubating
+      dis = new VersionedDataInputStream(dis, Version.GFE_90);
+    }
-    if (version.compareTo(Version.GFE_90) <= 0) {
-      InternalDistributedMember member = getDistributedMember();
+    // if we are sending to old clients we need to reserialize the ID
+    // using the client's version to ensure it gets the proper on-wire form
+    // of the identifier
+    // See GEODE-3072
+    if (version.compareTo(Version.GEODE_110) < 0) {
+      InternalDistributedMember member = getDistributedMember(version);
+      // reserialize with the client's version so that we write the UUID
+      // bytes
+    if (position < 0) {
+      return false;
+    }
