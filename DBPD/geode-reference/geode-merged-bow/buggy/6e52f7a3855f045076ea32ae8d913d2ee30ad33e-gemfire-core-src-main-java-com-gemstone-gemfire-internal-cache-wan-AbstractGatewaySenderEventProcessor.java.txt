GEODE-681: Measuring event queue size without using the stat for gfsh

The eventQueueSize stat has issues with concurrent events during start
and stop that are leading it to be inaccurate. To make gfsh and jmx
correct,  measuring the queue size directly from the underlying region
size.

Adding unit tests for the size methods.

-  protected int eventQueueSize() {
-    // This should be local size instead of PR size. Fix for #48627
+  public int eventQueueSize() {
+    if(queue == null) {
+      return 0;
+    }
+    
+    // This should be local size instead of pr size
