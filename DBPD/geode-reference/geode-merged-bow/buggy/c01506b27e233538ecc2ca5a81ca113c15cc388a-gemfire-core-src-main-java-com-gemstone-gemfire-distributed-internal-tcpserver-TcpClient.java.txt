GEODE-871: build-up of sockets in TIME_WAIT on locator machine

This change-set alters the client to abort its TCP/IP connection to
the locator by enabling SO_LINGER and setting the timeout to zero
before it closes the connection.  The Locator closes its connection
first, which puts it into TIME_WAIT.  The client then aborts the
connection, which cleans up the Locator's TIME_WAIT connection.

+        sock.setSoLinger(true, 0); // initiate an abort on close to shut down the locator's socket
+      if (out != null) {
+        out.close();
+      }
+        sock.setSoLinger(true, 0); // initiate an abort on close to shut down the server's socket
