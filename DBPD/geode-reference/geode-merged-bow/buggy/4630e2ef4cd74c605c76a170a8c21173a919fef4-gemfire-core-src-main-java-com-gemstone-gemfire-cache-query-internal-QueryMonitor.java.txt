fixing a test hook for a QueryMonitor unit test

The affected test will be moved to open-source in the up-coming
migration of the continuous-query project to open-source.  The
test hook wasn't quite robust enough and allowed a query that was

canceled.

+        if ((testException == null) && (query instanceof DefaultQuery)) {
+          if (((DefaultQuery)query).isCanceled()) {
+            testException = new QueryExecutionTimeoutException("The query task could not be found but the query is marked as having been canceled");
+          }
+        }
