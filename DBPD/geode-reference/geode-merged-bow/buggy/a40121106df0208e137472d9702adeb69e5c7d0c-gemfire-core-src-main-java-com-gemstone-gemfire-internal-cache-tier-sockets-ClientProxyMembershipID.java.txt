GEODE-77 IDs for old clients were serializing with V9.0

When a client cache ID was serialized by a 9.0 server to send to another
9.0 server the ID being transmitted was 9.0 instead of the clientVersion
instance variable.  This caused EOFExceptions when deserializing a
message containing the ID.

-      Version.CURRENT.writeOrdinal(out, true);
+      clientVersion.writeOrdinal(out, true);
+    
-    // must know their own version
+    // must know their own version.  If this ID was serialized with 9.0
+    // then it carries the version of the client
