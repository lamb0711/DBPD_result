GEODE-2485: fix leak in tx suspend/resume

The CCPTimer is now purged for every 1000 cancels done.
So we will now no longer have more than 1000
cancelled tasks eating up memory.
Now uses internalSuspend in two places the previously used suspend.
Since internalSuspend does not schedule a timer task
these places will have no more issues with leaking memory
and these code paths will perform better.

renamed resume(TxStateProxy) to internalResume for clarity.

internalResume no longer checks for a TimerTask to cancel
since internalSuspend does not add one.
Instead the only code that checks for a TimerTask is "resume".

-      this.cache.getTXMgr().resume(tx);
+      this.cache.getTXMgr().internalResume(tx);
-      this.cache.getTXMgr().resume(tx);
+      this.cache.getTXMgr().internalResume(tx);
-                this.cache.getTXMgr().resume(tx);
+                this.cache.getTXMgr().internalResume(tx);
