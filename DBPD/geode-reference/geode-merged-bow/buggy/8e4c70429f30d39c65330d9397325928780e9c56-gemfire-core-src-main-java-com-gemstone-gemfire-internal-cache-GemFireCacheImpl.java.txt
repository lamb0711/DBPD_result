GEODE-155:
- Fixes intermittent failure in RegionWithHDFS*DUnitTest about incorrect number of hoplog files getting created.
- Caused due to an earlier test not cleaning up static variables in ParallelGatewaySenderQueue.
- These are indeed cleaned up during GemFireCacheImpl.close() if there are any GatewaySenders running in the system.
- But if a region with gateway-senders associated with it, is destroyed first before a cache.close(), then the gateway senders are only stopped,
    and removed from allGatewaySenders list. But the static variables are not cleaned up.
- Later, during GemFireCacheImpl.close(), as the allGatewaySenders list is empty, it skips cleaning the static variables.
- As a fix, invoking a static clean-up method of ParallelGatewaySenderQueue explicitly during cache.close().
- Retained the non-static ParallelGatewaySenderQueue.cleanUp(), if required in future development for performing instance-specific clean-up.
- Minor formatting changes in the unit tests.

+          ParallelGatewaySenderQueue.cleanUpStatics(null);
