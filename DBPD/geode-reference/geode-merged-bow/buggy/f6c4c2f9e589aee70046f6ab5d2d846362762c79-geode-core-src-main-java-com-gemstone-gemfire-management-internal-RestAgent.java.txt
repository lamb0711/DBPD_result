GEODE-917: rename gemfire subprojects to geode

Rename the gemfire-* subdirectories to geode-*.  This has the effect
of changing the maven published artifacts as well.  For example,

gemfire-core-1.0.0-incubating.M2-SNAPSHOT.jar

is now

geode-core-1.0.0-incubating.M2-SNAPSHOT.jar

Also took the opportunity to rename gemfire-core-dependencies.jar
to geode-dependencies.jar.

-    final String gemfireAPIWar = agentUtil.findWarLocation("gemfire-web-api");
+    final String gemfireAPIWar = agentUtil.findWarLocation("geode-web-api");
-        logger.warn("Detected presence of catalina system properties. HTTP service will not be started. To enable the GemFire Developer REST API, please deploy the /gemfire-api WAR file in your application server."); 
+        logger.warn("Detected presence of catalina system properties. HTTP service will not be started. To enable the GemFire Developer REST API, please deploy the /geode-web-api WAR file in your application server.");
