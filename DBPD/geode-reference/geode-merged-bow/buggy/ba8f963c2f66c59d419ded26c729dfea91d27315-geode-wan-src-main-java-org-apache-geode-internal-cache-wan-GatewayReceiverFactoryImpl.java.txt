GEODE-3987: enforce GatewayReceiver uniqueness per member

* GEODE-3987: enforce GatewayReceiver uniqueness per member.

Enforcements added in the different creation entry points to prevent
the existence of more than one gateway receiver per member.

- Added several XML parsing tests.
- Added integration and Junit tests.
- DTD allows 0 or 1 occurrences of the <gateway-receiver> element.
- XSD allows 0 or 1 occurrences of the <gateway-receiver> element.
- GatewayReceiverFactory checks before creating new gateway receiver.
- Existing tests modified to use new MemberVM/GfshCommandRule features.

* GEODE-3987: enforce GatewayReceiver uniqueness per member.

Changes requested by reviewers have been incorporated.
