GEODE-7938: change dev rest api to support slashes in key parameters (#4885)

* Now uses ** instead of {keys}. This allows keys
to have a slash in them without the client needing
to encode the keys. Since the server no longer decodes
then this should not break any existing use cases.
* The swagger UI does not know what to do with ** but swagger docs were added describing that ** is a comma separated list of keys.

+import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
+
-   * @param keys for which data is requested
-  @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.DELETE, value = "/{region}/{keys}",
+  @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.DELETE, value = "/{region}/**",
-      notes = "Delete data for single key or specific keys in region")
+      notes = "Delete data for one or more keys in a region. The keys, ** in the endpoint, are a comma separated list.")
-  @PreAuthorize("@securityService.authorize('WRITE', #region, #keys)")
-      @PathVariable("keys") final String[] keys) {
+      HttpServletRequest request) {
+    String[] keys = parseKeys(request, region);
+    securityService.authorize("WRITE", region, keys);
