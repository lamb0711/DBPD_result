GEODE-4650: Refactor Elder selection (#2393)

GEODE-4650: Resolve race condition in selection of the elder

* no longer cache the elder, re-compute the elder when needed
* extract elder logic to a new class to make unit testing possible
* adds tests for elder selection
* adds tests of DLock Grantor failover
* removes isAdam() - isAdam used to mean that the member was alone (that there were no non-surprise, non-admin members in the cluster) when it joined. This was only used in two places. The first, in the DLockService, protected against recovering dlocks when there isn't a cluster. This usage is replaced with a check for isLoner(). The other use of isAdam was in ElderInitProcessor and was redundant with an inner check if there were other members in the distributed system.
* fix testFairness so that it can be run repeatedly in the same JVM
