GEODE-8020: buffer corruption in SSL communications (#4994)

revert change in GEODE-6661 that made NioSslEngine use a direct buffer.
This class is not designed to share its buffer with a pool in
BufferPool.  Connection is also modified to use a heap buffer for
reading encrypted SSL packets for consistency.  New tests ensure that
these buffers are the correct type when using SSL or plain sockets.
-    this.myNetData = bufferPool.acquireDirectSenderBuffer(packetBufferSize);
+    this.myNetData = bufferPool.acquireNonDirectSenderBuffer(packetBufferSize);
-      buffer = bufferPool.acquireDirectBuffer(bufferType, requiredSize);
+      buffer = bufferPool.acquireNonDirectBuffer(bufferType, requiredSize);
