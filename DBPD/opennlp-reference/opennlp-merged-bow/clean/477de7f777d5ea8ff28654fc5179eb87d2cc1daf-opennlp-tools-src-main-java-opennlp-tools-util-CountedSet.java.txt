Remove deprecated POSDictionaryWriter class

This class isn't used anymore in OpenNLP and was
deprecated long enough to be removed. Since 1.5.x
the Dictionary is used instead.

The CountedSet is only used by this class and is now
marked as deprecated to also remove it one day.

See issue OPENNLP-878
