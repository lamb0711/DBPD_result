OPENNLP-429: Modified the BaseModel behavior to allow serializers provided by tool factories.

Changed BaseModel to allow loading artifacts and serializers in two steps. The first will load basic artifacts and serializers, so we can load the manifest. Latter we can load information from manifest (factory name), get more serializers using this information, and finally loading more artifacts and serializers. To do that I had to change the BaseModel constructor, moving some of its code two methods that can be called by the sub-class at the right time.
All Model implementations had to change to add the post constructor actions;
