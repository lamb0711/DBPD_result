Replace poll with remove

The remove has the same error handling as Heap.extract,
both throw an exception in case the queue runs empty
and one more element is taken from it.

The poll method return null and will make this code then
fail later.

See issue OPENNLP-879

-        Sequence top = prev.poll();
+        Sequence top = prev.remove();
-      topSequences[seqIndex] = prev.poll();
+      topSequences[seqIndex] = prev.remove();
