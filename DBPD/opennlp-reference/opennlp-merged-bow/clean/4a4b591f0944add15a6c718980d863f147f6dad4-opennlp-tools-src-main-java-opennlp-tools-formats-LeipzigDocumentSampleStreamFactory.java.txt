Remove references to PlainTextByLineStream constructor that takes InputStream

The PlainTextByLineStream that takes InputStream was deprecated for a while. We can remove safely remove it after reviewing internal code that was still using it.
Left the deprecated code that was using the constructor for a latter work.

See issue OPENNLP-882

-        sampleStreams[i] = new LeipzigDoccatSampleStream(sentencesFiles[i].getName().substring(0, 3), 20,
-            CmdLineUtil.openInFile(sentencesFiles[i]));
+        sampleStreams[i] = new LeipzigDoccatSampleStream(
+            sentencesFiles[i].getName().substring(0, 3), 20,
+            CmdLineUtil.createInputStreamFactory(sentencesFiles[i]));
