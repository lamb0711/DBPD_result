OPENNLP-944: Add correction param and const back to GIS reader/writer

The two parameters need still to be written and read to maintain
backward compatibility with older models and 1.7.0 and 1.7.1.

+
+    // read correction constant (not used anymore)
+    readInt();
+
+    // read correction params (not used anymore)
+    readDouble();
