Change person eval test result

The person eval test fails and comes up with a different result,
this happens in trunk and 1.6.0 release version. In both cases
the computed value is 0.8299903903167106. It should be safe to
update the test.

See issue OPENNLP-868

-    crossEval(params, "person", 0.8269650989441869d);
+    crossEval(params, "person", 0.8299903903167106d);
