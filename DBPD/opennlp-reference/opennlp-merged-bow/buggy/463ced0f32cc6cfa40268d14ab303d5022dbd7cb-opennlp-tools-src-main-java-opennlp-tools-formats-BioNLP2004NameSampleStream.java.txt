OPENNLP-367: ConllX is UTF-8 always and is handled by the factory, Conll02 is UTF-8, Conll03 is ISO-8859-1, setup to set a System.out() to the same encoding as the input.  Should provide warning that the encoding may make the output non-legible by native system and the output needs to be piped or redirected to a file in all cases.
