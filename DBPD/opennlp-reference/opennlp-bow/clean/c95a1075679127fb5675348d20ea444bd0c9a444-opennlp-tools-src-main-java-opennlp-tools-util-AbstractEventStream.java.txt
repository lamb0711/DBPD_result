OPENNLP-768 Removed old EventStream related classes. Those are either part of the ml package and therefore not backward compatible, or deprecated

-import opennlp.tools.ml.model.EventStream;
-/**
- * This is a base class for {@link EventStream} classes.
- * It takes an {@link Iterator} of sample objects as input and
- * outputs the events creates by a subclass.
