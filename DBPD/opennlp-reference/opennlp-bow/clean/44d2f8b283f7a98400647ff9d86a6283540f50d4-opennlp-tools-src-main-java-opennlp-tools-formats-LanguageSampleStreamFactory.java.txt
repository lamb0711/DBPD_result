OPENNLP-402 Changed tools to only use language parameters on formats which actually need a language as input. Some tools use formats but do not make use of the language parameter at all. This seems confusing to the user when he is asked to specify a language when it is not at all used.

-  // language seems to belong to the stream, however, ObjectStream is used in 400+ places
-  // in the project and introducing new things to it is not a light decision.
