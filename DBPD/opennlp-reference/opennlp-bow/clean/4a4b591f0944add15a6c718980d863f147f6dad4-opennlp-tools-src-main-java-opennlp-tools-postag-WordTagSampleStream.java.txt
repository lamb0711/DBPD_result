Remove references to PlainTextByLineStream constructor that takes InputStream

The PlainTextByLineStream that takes InputStream was deprecated for a while. We can remove safely remove it after reviewing internal code that was still using it.
Left the deprecated code that was using the constructor for a latter work.

See issue OPENNLP-882
