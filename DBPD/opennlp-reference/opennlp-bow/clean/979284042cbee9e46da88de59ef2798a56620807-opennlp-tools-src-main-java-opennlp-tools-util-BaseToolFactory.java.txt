OPENNLP-434: Added some new functionality to the ToolFactory system: 1) now the BaseModel should initialize and store the serializers provided by the factories (before it was the role of a BaseModel sub-class); 2) a ToolFactory can provide manifest entries; 3) the ArtifactProvider interface provides reading access to the model manifest entries and language.
