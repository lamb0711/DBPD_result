OPENNLP-579
GeoEntityLinkerImpl: Implemented better scoring using Dice coefficient of bigram, as well as highly improved scoring based on country context. Created an NgramGenerator class and a FuzzyStringMatching class, assuming they would be useful for other linker impls. Implemented Regex based discovery of countrycontext, which enabled proximity based analysis of doctext
Multiple other small efficiencies in the GeoEntityLinker
