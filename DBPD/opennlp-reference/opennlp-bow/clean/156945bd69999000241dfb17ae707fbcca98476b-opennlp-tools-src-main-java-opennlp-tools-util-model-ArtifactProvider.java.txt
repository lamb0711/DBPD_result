OPENNLP-521: Mechanism to check POS Tagger dictionary only during its creation. Added a flag to the BaseModel (ArtifactProvider) to allow knowing if it was loaded from a stream. We use this flag to know if the dictionary should be validated or not.

git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/opennlp/trunk@1360365 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68

+   * @return true if this model was loaded from serialized
