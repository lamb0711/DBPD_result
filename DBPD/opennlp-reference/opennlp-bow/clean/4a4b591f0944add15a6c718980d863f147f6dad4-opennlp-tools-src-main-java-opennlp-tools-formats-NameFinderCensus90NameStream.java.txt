Remove references to PlainTextByLineStream constructor that takes InputStream

The PlainTextByLineStream that takes InputStream was deprecated for a while. We can remove safely remove it after reviewing internal code that was still using it.
Left the deprecated code that was using the constructor for a latter work.

See issue OPENNLP-882

+import opennlp.tools.util.InputStreamFactory;
+   * @param in  an <code>InputStreamFactory</code> for the input file.
+   * @param encoding  the <code>Charset</code> to apply to the input stream.
+   * @throws IOException 
+   */
+  public NameFinderCensus90NameStream(InputStreamFactory in, Charset encoding)
+      throws IOException {
+    this.locale = new Locale("en"); // locale is English
+    this.encoding = encoding;
+    this.lineStream = new PlainTextByLineStream(in, this.encoding);
+  }
+
+
+  /**
+   * This constructor takes an <code>InputStream</code> and a <code>Charset</code>
+   * and opens an associated stream object with the specified encoding specified.
+   *
+   * 
+   * @deprecated use {@link NameFinderCensus90NameStream#NameFinderCensus90NameStream(InputStreamFactory, Charset)}
