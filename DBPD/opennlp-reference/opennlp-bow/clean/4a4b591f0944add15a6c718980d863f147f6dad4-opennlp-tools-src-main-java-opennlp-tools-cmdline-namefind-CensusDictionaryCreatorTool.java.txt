Remove references to PlainTextByLineStream constructor that takes InputStream

The PlainTextByLineStream that takes InputStream was deprecated for a while. We can remove safely remove it after reviewing internal code that was still using it.
Left the deprecated code that was using the constructor for a latter work.

See issue OPENNLP-882

-import java.io.FileInputStream;
+import opennlp.tools.util.InputStreamFactory;
-    FileInputStream sampleDataIn = CmdLineUtil.openInFile(testData);
-    ObjectStream<StringList> sampleStream = new NameFinderCensus90NameStream(sampleDataIn,
-        Charset.forName(params.getEncoding()));
+    InputStreamFactory sampleDataIn = CmdLineUtil.createInputStreamFactory(testData);
-    try {
+    try (
+        ObjectStream<StringList> sampleStream = new NameFinderCensus90NameStream(
+            sampleDataIn, Charset.forName(params.getEncoding()))) {
-    } finally {
-      try {
-        sampleStream.close();
-      } catch(IOException e) {
-        // sorry this can fail..
-      }
