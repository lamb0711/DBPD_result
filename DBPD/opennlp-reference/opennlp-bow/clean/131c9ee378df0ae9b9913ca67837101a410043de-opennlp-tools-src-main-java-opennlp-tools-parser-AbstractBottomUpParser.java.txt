Comment debug log if parse can't be found

A user over at ctakes got confused by this message,
the program integrating the parser has to take care

found to the user.

See issue OPENNLP-869

-      System.err.println("no tag sequence");

+//    if (ts.length == 0) {
+//      System.err.println("no tag sequence");
+//    }
