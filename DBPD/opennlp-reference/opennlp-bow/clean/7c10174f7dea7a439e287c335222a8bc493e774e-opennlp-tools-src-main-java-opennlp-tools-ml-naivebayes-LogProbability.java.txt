OPENNLP-1285: Changing Math to StrictMath for Java 8 vs 11 test inconsistencies. (#377)


-    this.probability = Math.log(probability);
+    this.probability = StrictMath.log(probability);
-    double logP = Math.log(probability);
+    double logP = StrictMath.log(probability);
-    setLog(this.probability + Math.log(probability));
+    setLog(this.probability + StrictMath.log(probability));
-    return Math.exp(probability);
+    return StrictMath.exp(probability);
