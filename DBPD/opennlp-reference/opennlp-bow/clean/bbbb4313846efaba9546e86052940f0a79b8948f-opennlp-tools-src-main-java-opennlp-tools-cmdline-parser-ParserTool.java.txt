OPENNLP-1046: Correctly join tokens to text string

The text was one space too long which results in a different
parse tree if the method is used to reproduce an existing
parse tree as it is done by the parser evaluation tool.

-    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
-    for (String tok : tokens) {
-      sb.append(tok).append(" ");
-    }
-    String text = sb.substring(0, sb.length());
+    String text = String.join(" ", tokens);
+
