OPENNLP-944: Add correction param and const back to GIS reader/writer

The two parameters need still to be written and read to maintain
backward compatibility with older models and 1.7.0 and 1.7.1.

+    // the value of the correction constant (not used anymore)
+    writeInt(1);
+
+    // the value of the correction params (not used anymore)
+    writeDouble(1);
