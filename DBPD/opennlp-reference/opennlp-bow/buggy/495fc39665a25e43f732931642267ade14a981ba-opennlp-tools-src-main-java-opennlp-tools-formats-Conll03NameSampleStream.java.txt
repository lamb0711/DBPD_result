OPENNLP-367: CONLL 03 data for German & English must be in UTF-8.  I tried many combinations of ISO and the German doesn't come out correctly without UTF-8.  I'm hoping this fixes the last of the encoding issues for this round.

-      this.lineStream = new PlainTextByLineStream(in, "ISO-8859-1");
-      System.setOut(new PrintStream(System.out, true, "ISO-8859-1"));
+      this.lineStream = new PlainTextByLineStream(in, "UTF-8");
+      System.setOut(new PrintStream(System.out, true, "UTF-8"));
