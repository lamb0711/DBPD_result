OPENNLP-880: Refactor data indexer

1.) Added method to EventTrainer – train(DataIndexer indexer)
    –Then I added the method to AbstractEventTrainer.
    No other code needed to be changed.

2.) Created a new class – PluggableParmeters: Only AbstractTrainers
    had access to getXXXParam(Value,Default). So I pulled out this
    functionality into a separate class. Now both
    AbstractTrainers and AbstractDataIndexers can hold parameters.

3.) Refactored DataIndexer. This touched a lot of code.
    Added init(Map,Map) method and index(ObjectStream) method.
    Changed 1-Pass and 2-Pass DataIndexers. Everywhere 1-pass/2-pass
    indexers where created, I changed the constructor,
    and added the init and index methods.

4.) Changed GIS.doTrain(indexer) to use the parameters
    passed in the init method.

5.) QNTrainer – created a working init method. Changed the
    isValid method so it is not the init method.

This closes #14

-    addToReport(AbstractTrainer.TRAINER_TYPE_PARAM, SequenceTrainer.SEQUENCE_VALUE);
+    parameters.addToReport(AbstractTrainer.TRAINER_TYPE_PARAM, SequenceTrainer.SEQUENCE_VALUE);
