Working on: MNG-483

Fixing profile application to separate profiles discovered in and around POM from those in settings.xml, and apply them separately in the order: 

for-each-project-in-inheritance:{POM, profiles.xml}, settings.xml

Added common interface for accumulating, explicitly activating and deactivating, and retrieving profiles to be applied to a given project. This manager interface (ProfileManager) is general enough to be applicable to both the project-level and settings-level profiles.

Added 'performRelease'-keyed profile to super-POM which will be used by the release plugin and anyone using a parallel process, and which will enable '-DupdateReleaseInfo=true' for the deploy mojo, along with enabling the source attachment for the project.

Added 'attach' parameter to JarSourceMojo to allow local POM to turn off source attachments, overriding release profile in super-pom.

Updated the release:perform mojo to use '-DperformRelease=true' for switching on the new release profile, rather than just using '-DupdateReleaseInfo=true'...
