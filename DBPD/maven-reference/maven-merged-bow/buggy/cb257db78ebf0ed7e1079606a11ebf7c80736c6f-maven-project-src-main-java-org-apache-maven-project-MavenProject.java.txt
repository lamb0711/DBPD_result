Resolving:

MNG-511
MNG-513

Working on:

MNG-449

o Added code to stop the version manager from prompting the user for unregistered plugins; it will simply register them with the resolved version.

o Added failover fourth plugin-version resolution option, which is a plugin-specific artifact metadata called LATEST.version.txt, and will be published with each install/deployment

o Added MavenProject.get/setArtifact(..) to handle a single artifact instance for a project (allows injection of artifact metadata without having to handle it all within the install/deploy mojos).

o Changed plugin-version resolution to only use MavenMetadataSource rather than resolving the whole plugin artifact.

o Changed the install and deploy mojos to only use ${project.artifact} rather than constructing their own, so they can take advantage of metadata added elsewhere in the build.

o Factored the "RELEASE".equals(..) check in the DefaultRepositoryLayout to use new metadata method storedInArtifactDirectory() instead, since RELEASE and LATEST both share this characteristic.


NOTE: I'm not going to resolve MNG-449 yet, because I'm not sure what else Brett had in mind related to the plugin-development-without-release use case...
