CHANGES
------------------------

o Factored the layout for a repository into a separate set of components in o.a.m.a.repository.layout

o Added new DefaultRepositoryLayout that uses the repo layout in http://docs.codehaus.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=22230 (it is not used by default until we get the repo1 conversion done)

o Added command-line switches to force legacy local-repo or new format (-a/-A, I know, but try to find something that makes more sense!)

o Added path formatting to the repository itself, which is now constructed with a ArtifactRepositoryLayout instance (since layout should be tied to the repository)

o Removed path formatting altogether from the DefaultArtifactHandlerManager.

o Changed the AbstractArtifactBasedComponent (or whatever it's called) to use the repository formatting in the path() and localPath() methods.

o Moved the plugin repo construction (still intact as a hard-coded singleton list) into the DefaultMavenProjectBuilder, where it will eventually build from POM info.

o Added a new method to build an artifact repository for a <distributionManagement/> section, if possible. This reduced the strain on mojos to construct an ArtifactRepository on demand.

o Refactored all *DeployMojo to use #project.distributionManagementArtifactRepository instead of the #settings, #component..ArtifactRepositoryFactory, ... that it used to require. This is a big simplifying step.

o Removed remote artifact repository construction from DefaultMaven, and changed the MavenSession to delegate to MavenProject for remoteArtifactRepositories, just as it does for pluginRepositories.

o Added remoteArtifactRepositories, pluginArtifactRepositories, distributionManagementArtifactRepository to MavenProject as a cache for the higher-level repos used throughout the system. This is project info, so it belongs here.

o Fixed all the tests in maven-core and maven-artifact which I broke. :)

o Dropped what is probably a big format-bomb, since the Eclipse formatter doesn't really handle 'throws Exception' wrapping the right way.

o Added MavenProject to the MavenSession constructor, since there should always be a MavenProject associated with a build, even if it's just the super-pom.

TODO:
--------------------------

- Write an integration/unit test to ensure that the new repo format works with $classifier (was: $extra) and $groupId[0]/../$groupId[n]. This is a simple adaptation of the old layout, but still needs testing.
