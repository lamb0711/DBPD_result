o Added method to clone/fork model resolver which is a prerequisite for importing other POMs/mixins during the model building where the model builder basically recurses and we want the resolution processes for these sub POMs to be isolated

+     * the state of the original resolver and vice versa.
+     * 
+     * @return The cloned resolver, never {@code null}.
