[MNG-5754] Toolchains should be read during initialization
MavenExecutionRequest has been extended with toolchains, which is filled by MavenCli
Interfaces have been extended with new methods, assuming only Maven provides implementations

+import org.apache.maven.toolchain.model.PersistedToolchains;
+     * Copies the values from the given toolchains into the specified execution request. This method will replace any
+     * existing values in the execution request that are controlled by the toolchains. Hence, it is expected that this
+     * method is called on a new/empty execution request before the caller mutates it to fit its needs.
+     *
+     * @param request The execution request to populate, must not be {@code null}.
+     * @param toolchains The toolchains to copy into the execution request, may be {@code null}.
+     * @return The populated execution request, never {@code null}.
+     * @throws MavenExecutionRequestPopulationException If the execution request could not be populated.
+     * @since 3.2.6
+     */
+    MavenExecutionRequest populateFromToolchains( MavenExecutionRequest request, PersistedToolchains toolchains )
+        throws MavenExecutionRequestPopulationException;
