MNG-5695 fixed inconsistent/incomplete custom guice scope bindings

MojoExecution scope was only available for maven plugins and could not
be used for components defined in maven core or maven code extensions.

Session scope was only available for maven core and core extensions
but did not work for components from maven plugins.

Made both custom scopes available available in all realms.
