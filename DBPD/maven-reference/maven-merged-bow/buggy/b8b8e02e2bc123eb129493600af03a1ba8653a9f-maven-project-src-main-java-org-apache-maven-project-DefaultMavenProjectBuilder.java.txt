PR: MNG-1276
Submitted By: Edwin Punzalan
Reviewed By: John Casey

Applied patch, with some modifications. Specifically, changed the validation message when <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion> is not found, added reason to the warning line (no newlines here, just a hint at why it's wrong), and reformatted the debug output to be a bit more terse.

Thanks, Edwin.
