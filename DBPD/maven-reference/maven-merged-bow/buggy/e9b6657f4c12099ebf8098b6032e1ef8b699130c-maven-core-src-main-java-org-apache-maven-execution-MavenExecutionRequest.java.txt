o scrub of the settings building, was able to reduce to the need of the build context and use the execution request
  directly. eventually i will get it to be the session, along with the profile tools, then all the tools can also 
  share a common interpolator, which can then be shared by other components instead of having 5 interpolators lying
  around causing a great deal of inconsistency.
