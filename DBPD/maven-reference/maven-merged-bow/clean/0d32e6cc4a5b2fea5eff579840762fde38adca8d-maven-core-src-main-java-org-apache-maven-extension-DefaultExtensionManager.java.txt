some documentation for new extension and project-level session stuff, and trying a fix for the extension manager test that may help things on windows where forceDelete(..) fails.

+        // create a new MavenProjectSession instance for the current project.
+        // This session instance will house the plugin and extension realms that
+        // pertain to this specific project, along with containing the project-level
+        // realm to use as a lookupRealm in the lifecycle executor and plugin manager.
+        // Create an entire new ClassWorld, ClassRealm for discovering
+        // the immediate components of the extension artifact, so we don't pollute the
+        // container with component descriptors or realms that don't have any meaning beyond discovery.
+            // Find the extension component descriptors that exist ONLY in the immediate extension
+            // artifact...this prevents us from adding plexus-archiver components to the mix, for instance,
+            // when the extension uses that dependency.
+                    // For each component in the extension artifact:
+                        // Import the extension component's implementation class into the project-level
+                        // realm.
+                        // Set the realmId to be used in looking up this extension component to the
+                        // project-level realm, since we now have a restricted import
+                        // that allows most of the extension to stay hidden, and the
+                        // specific local extension components are still accessible
+                        // from the project-level realm.
+
+                        // Finally, add the extension component's descriptor (with projectRealm
+                        // set as the lookup realm) to the container.
