o convert as much as i can in maven-core to use the annotation processor. it revealed a bug where given certain circumstances
  if a component was a requirement it prevents the actual component descriptor for that requirement to be output. worked
  around that by using the javadoc annotations on 5 problem classes. i'll fix the processor before converting the rest.
