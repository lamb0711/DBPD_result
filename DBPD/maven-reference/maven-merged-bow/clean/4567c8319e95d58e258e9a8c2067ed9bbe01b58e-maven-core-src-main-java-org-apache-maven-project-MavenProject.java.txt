MNG-5818: Disallow the programmatic injection of project dependencies

The first step here is deprecating the publicly accessible method that allows
plugins to inject dependencies. The only plugin I currently know of that does
this is the cobertura-maven-plugin. Looking at that plugin it appears the user
can specify the cobertura dependency for the instrumentation process but if
they do not the plugin attempts to inject the dependency. I believe the path
forward here is making sure these types of plugins instruct their users to
add the dependency explicitly.

I'm going to try and create a call-graph for all of Maven Central with my
first test to see if I can accurately detect all usages of MavenProject.setDependencyArtifacts
of artifact in Maven Central.
