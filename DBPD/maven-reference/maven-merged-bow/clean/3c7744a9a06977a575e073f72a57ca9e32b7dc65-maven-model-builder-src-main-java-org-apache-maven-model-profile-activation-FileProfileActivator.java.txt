[MNG-5590] improved documentation about interpolation on file activation
+ * File name interpolation support is limited to <code>${basedir}</code>,
+ * System properties and request properties.
+ * <code>${project.basedir}</code> is intentionally not supported as this form would suggest that other
+ * <code>${project.*}</code> expressions can be used, which is however beyond the design.
