o injecting the metadata sources results in having to do some trickery to break the circular dependency between the components, this
  is visible now in the metadata source which shows we need to do some work there as circular deps are pretty sure sign of poor design
o the ProjectClasspathTest has little stub components so I'm not even sure if it's a decent test but it requires a bunch of custom
  implementations as i tried to get rid of the hand written descriptor and have only annotated tests implementations but somewhere
  an incorrect implementations is being injected.

I'll work on breaking the circular dependency and we need a nicer way to inject test implementations, the way the Module works in
Guice is the way to go. We'll bridge the gap until we can switch over to Guice.
