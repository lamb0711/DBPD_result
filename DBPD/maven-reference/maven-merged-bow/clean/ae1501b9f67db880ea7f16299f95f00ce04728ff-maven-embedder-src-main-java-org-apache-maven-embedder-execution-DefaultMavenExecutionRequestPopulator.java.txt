o collecting all logging/eventing into the core. i posted a list of possible errors that can occur in the core, the stuff we had was only
  partially being use and we problems being emitted with messages like:

  NOTE: One or more purely derived expression elements were detected in this expression. 
  If you continue to get this error after any other expression elements are specified correctly
  please report this issue to the Maven development team.

  I think we have to make a very concerted effort to make useful messages because I'm tired of standing behind Maven
  users and being embarrassed when they look at me and ask "what does that mean?". "i actually have no idea."
