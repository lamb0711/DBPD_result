- Percentage is a string with a percent symbol.
- Modified code under test so that TPC is 66,66% and not 100% (just because I can). Added a conditional statement.
- The clover:check still fails but I've pinpointed it to the fact that the surefire plugin does not fork tests and thus the coverage database is empty when the check occurs (that's because by default clover re-initializes the database upon a new instrumentation - Using a span attribute makes it work but that's not what we want).
