o Ok, this set of changes has been tested against the integration tests in
  maven-core-it and it is now a requirement that the integration tests be
  done before checking in any changes. They are not super rigourous but
  they do test the minimal functionality of compiling, processing resources
  and testing.

  I'm going to make another release this week and things should now be
  in a stable enough form to actually use m2 for the basics.
