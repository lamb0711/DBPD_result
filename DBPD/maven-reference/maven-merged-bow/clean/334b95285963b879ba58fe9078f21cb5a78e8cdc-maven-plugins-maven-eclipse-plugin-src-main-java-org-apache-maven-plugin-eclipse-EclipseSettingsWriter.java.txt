o Did some refactoring: moving utility methods to EclipseUtils so there's no
  confusion as to which project is used.

o Use executedProject everywhere except for acquiring the artifact list; the 
  executedProject misses that list (that's because no deps are resolved in
  the forked lifecycle execution; it's delayed until the plugin is encountered
  and it's requiresDependencyResolution is seen.)

o Added flag -Declipse.downloadSources=true|false to skip source downloading
