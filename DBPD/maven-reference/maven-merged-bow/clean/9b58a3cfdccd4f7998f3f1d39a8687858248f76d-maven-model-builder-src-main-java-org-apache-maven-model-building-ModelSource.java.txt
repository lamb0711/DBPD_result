MNG-5444 fixed building MavenProject from ModelSource

To maintain compatibility with (the extremely unlikely) existing
implementations of ModelSource, the new API methods are provided
via optional ModelSource2 interface. Updated javadoc to encourage
use of the new API.

+ * <p>
+ * This interface does not support loading of parent POM(s) from the same backing store, integrators are strongly
+ * encouraged to implement {@link ModelSource2} instead of implementing this interface directly.
+ * @see ModelSource2
