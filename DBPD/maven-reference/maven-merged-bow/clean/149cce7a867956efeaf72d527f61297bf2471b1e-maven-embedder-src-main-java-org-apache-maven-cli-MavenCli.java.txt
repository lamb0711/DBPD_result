[MNG-5977] Improve output readability of our MavenTransferListener implementations

* Applied a general decimal formatter which automatically scales file sizes between [0,10) (one decimal digit) and [10,1000) (whole numbers) along with proper size and time units
* The progress meter will now properly
** tell the amount of transfers along with file names (in debug mode) and absolute progress by size
** visually seperate parallel transfers with " | "
* Optimized and reduced padding to the cases where it actually is necessary
* Padding has to be applied to every event which can succeed with progress update
* Synchronize all calls to console to avoid race conditions where output is terminated by a carriage return only. If no sync is done, SLF4J or INIT/SUCCEEDED update can interleave and overwrite the progress while being shorter as the progress itself.
* Replaced the concurrent hash map with a synchronized linked hash map to retain order of the progress meter. It will behave now like a queue.
* Work around a rounding bug existed upto Java 7
  See http://stackoverflow.com/q/22797964/696632 and Oracle's bugfix
  Announcement: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8-compatibility-guide-2156366.html

Race conditions cannot be avoided if -T is employed since one does not have access to the output stream of a SLF4J backend to synchronize on.
