Working on: MNG-377

o Added maven-plugin-mapping project to handle repository metadata that contains prefix-to-artifactId mappings for groups of plugins

o Added builder classes for plugin mappings

o Modified maven-artifact and maven-artifact-manager to handle the concept of repository metadata in addition to artifact metadata.

o Added pluginGroups section to settings.xml, new code to merge these lists of plugin groups, and a unit test to ensure that this merge is taking place properly.

o Added maven-plugin-mapping to dependencies of maven-core, along with the list of builds to be performed by mboot.

Should be ready to incorporate plugin mapping consultation into the lifecycle executor and the deploy mojo...
