Updated the notes about the order of processing and a small problem with the conflation of duplicate checkingin getProjectMap

-    // 6) Get reactor projects looking for read errors, and duplicate declarations
+    // 6) Get reactor projects looking for general POM errors
-    // 8) Create ReactorReader with the project map created in 7)
+    // 8) Create ReactorReader with the getProjectMap( projects ). NOTE that getProjectMap(projects) is the code that
+    //    checks for duplicate projects definitions in the build. Ideally this type of duplicate checking should be part of
+    //    getting the reactor projects in 6). The duplicate checking is conflated with getProjectMap(projects).
