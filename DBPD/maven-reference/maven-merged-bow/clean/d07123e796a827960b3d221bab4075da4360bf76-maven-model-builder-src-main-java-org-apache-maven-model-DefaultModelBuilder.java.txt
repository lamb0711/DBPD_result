o Fixed model building to account for default values that can't be set in the MDO. The use case we have for this is the scope for dependencies: Setting this in the MDO would cause injection of the default in the raw model and would interfere with the superposition of dependency management. The 2.x code handles this via a side effect of MavenMetadataSource.createArtifact() which doesn't look like a clean way to go.
