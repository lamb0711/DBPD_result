Working on issue: MNG-469

o Changed <reports/> in the Model to <reporting/>, to accommodate the <reports/> inside of <reportSet/>.

o Changed the report-plugin class <plugins/> inside of <report[ing]/> to <reporters/>, which means using a new class called Reporter (this is meant to be a Plugin-like model for reports, with reportSets rather than executions...)

o Changed the MavenProject to reflect these two model changes

o Added support to the inheritance assembler to perform deep inheritance of the reporting model (complete with calculations based on the <inherit/> attributes on Reporter and ReportSet).

o Updated DoxiaMojo, Pom, and DefaultPluginVersionManager to reflect the new model classes and MavenProject methods.

This is only round one of the changes for this issue. The next step is to start binding report configuration to the plugin manager via the lifecycle executor (it will traverse the reporting section, and verifyPlugin() to enable direct calls to the report's mojo).
