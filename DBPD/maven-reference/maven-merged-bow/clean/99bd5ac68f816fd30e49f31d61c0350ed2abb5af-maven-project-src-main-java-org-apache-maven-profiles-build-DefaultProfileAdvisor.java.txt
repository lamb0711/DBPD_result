o trying to get a grasp of the entire profile mechanism, especially in relation to how they deal with repositories.
  here i am just collecting all the profile code into one place as it's scattered over several packages and is
  hard to determine what the profile system as a whole is doing. the first task i would like to do is decouple
  the profile system from the Settings. this can be done at the front-end i.e the profile information from Settings
  can be fed into the profile manager up front.
