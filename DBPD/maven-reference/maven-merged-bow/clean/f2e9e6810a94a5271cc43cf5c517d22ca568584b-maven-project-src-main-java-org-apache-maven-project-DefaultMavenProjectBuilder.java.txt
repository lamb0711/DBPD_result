- * inheritance
- * path translation
- * interpolation
- * defaults injection
-
- Current processing is:
-
- * inheritance
- * interpolation
- * defaults injection
- * path translation
-
- I'm not sure how this is working at all ... i think i have a case where this is failing but i need to
- encapsulate as a test so i can fix it. Also need to think of the in working build directory versus looking
- things up from the repository i.e buildFromSource vs buildFromRepository.
-
-Notes
-
- * when the model is read it may not have a groupId, as it must be inherited
-
- * the inheritance assembler must use models that are unadulterated!
