Problem in merging artifact containers, where one container specified a default type value (jar) and the other did not. They were treated as different types. Fixed this.

git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/components/trunk@718375 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68

-                type = "";
+                type = "jar";
-                scope = "";
+                scope = "compile";
