o be more lenient when looking for the properties file. in my case i am debugging completely from the eclipse workspace and i don't want to have to produce the JAR everytime i want to execute maven. these properties files should be created as part of the generate resources phase and not buried in the maven archiver and performed during JAR production. bad mixing of concerns.

-                throw new IllegalStateException( "Unable to find Maven properties in classpath: " + MAVEN_PROPERTIES );
+                return new ApplicationInformation( new DefaultArtifactVersion( version ), builtOn );
