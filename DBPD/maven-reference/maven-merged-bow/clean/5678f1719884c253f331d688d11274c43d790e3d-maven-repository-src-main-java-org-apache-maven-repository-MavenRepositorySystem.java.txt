o nuke another big chunk of the old code, looking for available versions is used internally and once all the methods are shed we'll supply a pure metadata resolution for clients, like IDEs, that need to nicely show versions. we'll also provide a graph too so people aren't going to have to  do all the extra crap to get decent information.

-    extends ArtifactMetadataSource // This needs to be removed and it's here because it's passed into the resolver. not sure why we didn't just inject the metadata source.
-        throws ArtifactMetadataRetrievalException;
-    
-    // Retrieving available versions is a function of what repositories that you pass in. If you want local and remote versions then you pass
-    // in both those repositories. We don't need two methods here.
-    List<ArtifactVersion> retrieveAvailableVersions( Artifact artifact, ArtifactRepository localRepository, List<ArtifactRepository> remoteRepositories )
-        throws ArtifactMetadataRetrievalException;
