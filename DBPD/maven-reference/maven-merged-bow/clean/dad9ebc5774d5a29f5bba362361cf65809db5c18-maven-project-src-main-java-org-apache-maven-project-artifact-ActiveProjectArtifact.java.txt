o Fixing DoxiaMojo (there was an API incompatibility there, having to do with FileUtils...not sure if there is something that didn't get deployed, or what)

o Adding cli-options.txt for three ITs that failed when I cleaned out the local repo

o Fixing the setFile(..) method of ActiveProjectArtifact (hopefully) for Emmanuel's continuum build problem...
