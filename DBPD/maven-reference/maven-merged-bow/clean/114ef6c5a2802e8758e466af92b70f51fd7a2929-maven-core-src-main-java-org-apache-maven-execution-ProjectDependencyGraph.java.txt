[MNG-6173] MavenSession.getAllProjects() should return all projects in the reactor

This commit removes the initialization of the MavenSession object from the
DefaultGraphBuilder. The GraphBuilder implementation should only build the
graph and should not touch the MavenSession object passed into it.

To allow complete initialization of the MavenSession the ProjectDependencyGraph
interface got enhanced so that GraphBuilder implementations can communicate all
collected projects in addition to the processed list of projects.

This closes #105

+     * Gets all collected projects.
+     *
+     * @return All collected projects.
+     *
+     * @since 3.5.0-alpha-2
+     */
+    List<MavenProject> getAllProjects();
