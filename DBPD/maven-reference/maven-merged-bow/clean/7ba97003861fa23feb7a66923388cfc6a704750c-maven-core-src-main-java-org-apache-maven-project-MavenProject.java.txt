[MNG-6698] Lazily compute the ManagedVersionMap

This map is not used by Maven and the computation can be quite heavy, so lazily
compute it. In addition, do not clone the map as it's an unmodifiable one already.

This closes #263

-            setManagedVersionMap( new HashMap<>( project.getManagedVersionMap() ) );
+            setManagedVersionMap( project.getManagedVersionMap() );
