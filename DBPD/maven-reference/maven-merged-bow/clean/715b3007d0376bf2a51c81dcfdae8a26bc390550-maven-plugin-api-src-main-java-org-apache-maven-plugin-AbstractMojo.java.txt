-     * By default, return a <code>SystemStreamLog</code> logger.
-     *
+     * Returns the logger that has been injected into this mojo. If no logger has been setup yet, a <code>SystemStreamLog</code>
+     * logger will be created and returned.
+     * <br/><br/>
+     * <strong>Note:</strong>
+     * The logger returned by this method must not be cached in an instance field during the construction of the mojo.
+     * This would cause the mojo to use a wrongly configured default logger when being run by Maven. The proper logger
+     * gets injected by the Plexus container <em>after</em> the mojo has been constructed. Therefore, simply call this
+     * method directly whenever you need the logger, it is fast enough and needs no caching.
+     *
