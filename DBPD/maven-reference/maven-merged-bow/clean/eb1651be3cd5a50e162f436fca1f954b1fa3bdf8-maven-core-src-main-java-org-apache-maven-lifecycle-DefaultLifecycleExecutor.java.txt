Fixing CI. Had to move the addPlugin(..) call back to its original spot, and expose a new method in MavenProject to inject PluginManagement info to a Plugin instance that's passed in as a parameter.


git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/components/trunk@344294 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68

-        // this has been simplified from the old code that injected the plugin management stuff, since
-        // pluginManagement injection is now handled by the project method.
-        project.addPlugin( plugin );
-
+        project.injectPluginManagementInfo( plugin );
+        
+        // this has been simplified from the old code that injected the plugin management stuff, since
+        // pluginManagement injection is now handled by the project method.
+        project.addPlugin( plugin );
