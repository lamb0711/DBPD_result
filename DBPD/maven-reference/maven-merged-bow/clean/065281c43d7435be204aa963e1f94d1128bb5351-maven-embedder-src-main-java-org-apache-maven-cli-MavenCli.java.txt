[MNG-5607] Don't use M2_HOME in mvn shell/command scripts anymore

* Variable has been removed and replaced with an internal one which
  cannot be overriden from outside. From now on, it is an
  implementation detail which it should have been from the beginning.
* Cleaned up license header and style of the variable description
  section graciously borrowed from the Tomcat start scripts.

+                    "-D%s system property is not set.", MULTIMODULE_PROJECT_DIRECTORY );
