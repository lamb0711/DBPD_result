[MNG-5390] mvn -rf (no argument) results in NPE

Created a simple primordial logger that implements the error methods required between CLI parsing and logger initialization. I don't want to have to look to see if the logger is null.

+import org.apache.maven.cli.logging.Slf4jStdoutLogger;
+        //
+        // Parsing errors can happen during the processing of the arguments and we prefer not having to check if the logger is null
+        // and make construct this so we can use an SLF4J logger everywhere
+        //
+        slf4jLogger = new Slf4jStdoutLogger();
+
