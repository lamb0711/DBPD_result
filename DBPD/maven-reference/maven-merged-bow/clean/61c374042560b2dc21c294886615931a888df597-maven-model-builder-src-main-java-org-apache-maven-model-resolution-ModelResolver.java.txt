Fixes MNG-5663 - a regression introduced in 3.2.2 by MNG-5639 that prevents nested import POMs from resolving their dependencies.

The cuplrit was the resetRepositories method in tandem with the repository
list instances being shared between ModelResolvers.

- The copy constructor for the ModelResolvers now creates new lists.
- The resetRepositories method has been removed. Instead there is a
'replace' parameter on the addRepository method that allows the
ïœˆdesired parameter replacement of MNG-5639 to take place.

-     * Resets repositories, has the effect of clearing any repositories previously added by the
-     * {link #addRepository(Repository) method
+     * Adds a repository to use for subsequent resolution requests. The order in which repositories are added matters,
+     * repositories that were added first should also be searched first. When multiple repositories with the same
+     * identifier are added, then the value of the replace argument is determines the behaviour.
+     *
+     * If replace is false than any existing repository with the same Id will remain in use. If replace
+     * is true the new repository replaces the original.
+     *
+     * @param repository The repository to add to the internal search chain, must not be {@code null}.
+     * @throws InvalidRepositoryException If the repository could not be added (e.g. due to invalid URL or layout).
-    void resetRepositories();
+    void addRepository( Repository repository, boolean replace )
+            throws InvalidRepositoryException;
