[MNG-6078] Can't overwrite properties which have been defined in
.mvn/maven.config
 o Reversed the order of properties only to get the properties from
   command line at the end of the properties list which results
   in correct behaviour to be able to overwrite properties from
   command line for properties which have been defined in
   .mvn/maven.config file.

+import org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils;
-    private void properties( CliRequest cliRequest )
+    //Needed to make this method package visible to make writing a unit test possible
+    //Maybe it's better to move some of those methods to separate class (SoC).
+    void properties( CliRequest cliRequest )
-
+            
+                //The following is needed to get precedence
+                //of properties which are defined on command line
+                //over properties defined in the .mvn/maven.config. 
+                ArrayUtils.reverse( defStrs );
+
