change resolve() methods to not return Artifact - but instead modify the original. Artifact is immutable except for version so it is safe - but will it cost flexibility later. Currently, this makes it much simpler as less copying vigilance is required.
This has ironed out most wrinkles. Still need to implement the snapshot checking cache, and special case the use of installed snapshots over deployed ones.

-            artifact = artifactResolver.resolve( artifact, remoteArtifactRepositories, localRepository );
+            artifactResolver.resolve( artifact, remoteArtifactRepositories, localRepository );
