Resolving issue: MNG-503 (another patch from Kenney Westerhof applied)

o Tracked down the potential NPE when using a list of dependencies in the DependencyTask (it needs a Pom in order to create an originating artifact)...creating a dummy Pom instance when the list of dependencies is supplied, since I assume the originatingArtifact is used for tracking/graphing purposes. This new method, called createDummyPom() is in AbstractArtifactTask, so it's available for use in InstallTask and DeployTask if necessary...

Thanks, Kenney!
