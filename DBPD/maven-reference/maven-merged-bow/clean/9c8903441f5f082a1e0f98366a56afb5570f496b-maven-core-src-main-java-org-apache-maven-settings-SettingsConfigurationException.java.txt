o profiles are now decoupled from settings. so that i don't do this is one huge commit i need to move settings stuff into the core
  while i transform the settings components to take a MavenSession. Any component executing within Maven should be able to use
  a session. the session will contain everything required and any new component added to the system should only take the 
  session as a parameter. same pattern for all components. that's the goal. it will take a few hops.

+package org.apache.maven.settings;
