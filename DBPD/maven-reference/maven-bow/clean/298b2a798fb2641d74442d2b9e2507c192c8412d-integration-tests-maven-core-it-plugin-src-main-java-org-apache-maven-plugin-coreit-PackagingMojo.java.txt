o This fixes the failing it0040 IT

  Now someone might have some more insight here because this failure didn't crop up until yesterday.
  About 3 months ago maven-archiver was changed so that the client was responsible for setting
  the archiver implementation using:

  archiver.setArchiver( new JarArchiver() );

  But this code is something that I just added to the PackagingMojo.java file. Using -X says that
  version 2.0 of maven-archiver is being used so I'm not exactly sure what is going on here. An
  older version of maven-archiver set up its archiver internally so I suppose it might be possible
  that something older then 2.0 was being used but this IT should have broken long ago looking
  at the code in the PackagingMojo.
