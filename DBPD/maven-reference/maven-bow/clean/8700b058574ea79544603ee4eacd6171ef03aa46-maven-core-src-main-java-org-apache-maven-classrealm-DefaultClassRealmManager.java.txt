MNG-5530 Introduced mojo execution guice component scope

Mojo execution scoped components are annotated with @MojoExecutionScoped
They are created just before configured mojo instance is created
and disposed immediately after mojo execution finishes.

Execution scoped components can request @Inject MavenSession,
MavenProject and MojoExecution instances in addition to any
standard Maven core components and components defined in
maven plugin contributing execution scoped components.

Execution scoped components can be injected into Mojos using
standard /* @component */ javadoc (and likely new mojo
annotations).

If execution scoped component implements MojoExecutionListener
callback interface, its #afterMojoExecutionSuccess method will be
invoked after successful mojo execution and #afterMojoExecutionAlways
method will be executed after both successful and failed mojo
executions.
