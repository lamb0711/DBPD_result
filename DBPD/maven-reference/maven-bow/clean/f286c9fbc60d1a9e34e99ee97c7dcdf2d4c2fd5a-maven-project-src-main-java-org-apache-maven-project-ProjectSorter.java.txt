Create artifact directory as the Get task doesn't create them

NOTE: accidently commited other files too. Only build.xml was 
  supposed to be committed.
  - it0074/pom.xml: leave as is; it fixes a <depedencies> section;
  - maven-plugin-tools-java/pom.xml was fixed by jason at revision 462919;
  - ProjectSorter.java is fixed in revision 463922;
