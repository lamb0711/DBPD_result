o update the scripts for maven for the change in the location of classworlds,
  which reflects the location that the plexus runtime builder places
  classworlds

o change the internal configuration to match some of the changes made to
  plexus to account for elimination of xstream as a dependency. We're not
  all the way there because xstream is still required in the plugin tools.

o a little exception handler stub which I'm going to use to clean up the
  huge stack traces that comes out. Going to map specific exceptions to
  specific errors messages and to specific entries in a FAQ to help users
  learn about commons errors.
