[MNG-6638] Prevent reparsing POMs in MavenMetadataSource

If a dependency on another project is found, don't parse its
POM again, but instead use the model we already have in memory.
This saves a large amount of time and memory for builds that have
lots of subprojects and dependencies between them.
The approach was directly copied from DefaultArtifactDescriptorReader,
which does the same optimization.

This closes #244

-            // hack: don't rebuild model if it was already loaded during reactor resolution
