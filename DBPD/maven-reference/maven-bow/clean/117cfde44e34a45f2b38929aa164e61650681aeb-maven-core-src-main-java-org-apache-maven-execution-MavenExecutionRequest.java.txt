[MNG-5760] Several fixes for the --resume feature.

BuildResumptionDataRepository is not used in MavenCli

Make setResume() on MavenExecutionRequest a traditional setter

Fix resolution of resume.properties file

Add unit test for DefaultBuildResumptionDataRepository#applyResumptionData

Avoid storing and using an empty excludedProjects field in the resume.properties file.

Avoid star imports

Don't create a unneeded Path when resolving resume.properties

Support the scenario where the first project was failed, but subsequent projects succeeded. (e.g. by fail-at-end or parallel builds)

Maven invocations without project shouldn't fail

+     * @param resume Whether or not to resume a previous build.
-    MavenExecutionRequest setResume();
+    MavenExecutionRequest setResume( boolean resume );
