o the introduction of the lifecycle stuff we've been chatting about so you
  can now do things like:

  m2 package

  which makes the jar

  m2 install

  which installs the jar

  m2 test

  You can also execute individual goals still like:

  clean:clean
  pom:install
  idea:idea

  Execution of goals this way will still have the dependency resolution
  flag obeyed but they are run in isolation in that pre/post goals don't
  exist anymore. You need to slot your mojos into the lifecycle.

  I will add the mechanism whereby configuring a plugin will push
  the mojo into the lifecycle.
