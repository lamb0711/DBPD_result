I'm reverting this as per Benjamin: the change to the artifact filter is an optimization to avoid downloading needless artifacts, but for cases of uber JARs or other stuff pulling in those packages, the class realm manager's imports are crucial

+        imports.put( "org.eclipse.aether.internal.impl", coreRealm );
