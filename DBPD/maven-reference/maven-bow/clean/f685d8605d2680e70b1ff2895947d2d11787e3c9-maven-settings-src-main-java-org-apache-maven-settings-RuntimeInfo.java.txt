Resolving: MNG-449, MNG-152, MNG-1090, MNG-1089, MNG-1122

o Removed -cpl and related command line switches for controlling use of LATEST metadata for resolving plugin versions
o Made LATEST the only metadata used to resolve plugin versions, since this is also available when releases are performed
o Added various error diagnostics for project build exceptions
o Enhanced artifact not found error diagnostics
o Removed maven-project and added maven-artifact to maven-surefire-plugin's pom
o Removed the stanza that added pluginArtifacts to the test-booter's classpath...they are already covered by the classpathElements
o Fixed ITs in connection to the removal of -cpl
o Changed the plugin manager to detect whether a plugin's artifact file has changed since the plugin container was created...if so, reload it.
o Took the projecthelp plugin out of the build until I can diagnose the problems with its build (probably tomorrow).
