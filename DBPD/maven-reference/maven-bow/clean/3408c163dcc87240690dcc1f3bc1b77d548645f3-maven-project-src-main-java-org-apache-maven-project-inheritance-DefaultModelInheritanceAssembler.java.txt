o Removed it0048, and replaced it with a unit test for the DefaultProfileInjector.
o Reverted the logic of the DefaultProfileInjector to merge-and-override the model, with the profile being dominant
o Added merging for distributionManagement and modules (conditionally, based on flag) in the modelBase merge
o Refactored the override logic into a couple of methods in ModelUtils to make it easier to understand what's going on here.
o Verified that both the build and the model itself are being merged correctly during profile injection, with profile dominance, but persistence of changes to the model.
