[MNG-1980] Removing the duplicate ID, the reactor will catch duplicate IDs in a single build so it doesn't not need
           to be checked for in the project builder. I have removed the model caching for now while I'm refactoring
           the project builder. The plan is to break the 1000+ lines down into its constituent components and use
           a pipeline to build up the project.
