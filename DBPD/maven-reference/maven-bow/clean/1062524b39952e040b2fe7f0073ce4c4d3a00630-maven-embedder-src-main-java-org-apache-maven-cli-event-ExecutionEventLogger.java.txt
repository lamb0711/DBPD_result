[MNG-5396] changed logger name for execution events and batch transfer
(was MavenCli)

this shows some logging patterns we should discuss about and document
our conventions
+import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
- * Logs execution events to a user-supplied logger.
+ * Logs execution events to logger, eventually user-supplied.
+    public ExecutionEventLogger()
+    {
+        logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger( ExecutionEventLogger.class );
+    }
+
+    // TODO should we deprecate?
