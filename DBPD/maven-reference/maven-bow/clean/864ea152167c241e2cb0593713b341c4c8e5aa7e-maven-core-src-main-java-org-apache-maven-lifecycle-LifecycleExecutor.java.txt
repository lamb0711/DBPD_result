o refactoring the way plugin prefix metadata is found. the lifecycle executor is not the right place for this and the plugin manager is now strictly for already fully configured executions. so it belongs somewhere specific to augmenting the base set of information in order to make it complete but this first pass will do here. i just want to check it in as well because i'm traveling.
