o make a very simple utility for creating our artifact filter so that it can be shared by the
  plugin manager and the extension manger. now used in the extension manager to block out
  deps that are already present in the maven classloading system. so that something like
  the external provider can be listed in an extension and will be dealt with: this was
  causing a loader constraint violation.

+ * @todo possibly fix the signatures, it's unfortunate that in some methods the local repo is listed first and second in others.
