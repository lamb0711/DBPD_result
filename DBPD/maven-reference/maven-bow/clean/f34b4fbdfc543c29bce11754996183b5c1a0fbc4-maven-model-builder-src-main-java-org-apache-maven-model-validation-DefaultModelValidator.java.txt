[MNG-5477] finally removed reporting plugin version validation since a
warning is issued in maven-site-plugin in case of missing version. Then
removed reporting plugin version injection too
-
-                    validateStringNotEmpty( "reporting.plugins.plugin.version", problems, errOn31, Version.V20, p.getVersion(),
-                                            p.getKey(), p );
