[MNG-6632] - Remember artifact handlers after they've been used once

Otherwise we have to go through the whole sisu engine again,
which is very slow, because it does a linear scan.

-    private Map<String, ArtifactHandler> unmanagedHandlers = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
+    private Map<String, ArtifactHandler> allHandlers = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
-        ArtifactHandler handler = unmanagedHandlers.get( type );
+        ArtifactHandler handler = allHandlers.get( type );
+            else
+            {
+                allHandlers.put( type, handler );
+            }
-        unmanagedHandlers.putAll( handlers );
+        allHandlers.putAll( handlers );
