+ * Replaces expressions of the form <tt>${token}</tt> with their effective values. Effective values are basically
+ * calculated from the elements of the model itself and the execution properties from the building request.

+    /**
+     * The name of a property that if present in the model's {@code <properties>} section specifies a custom format for
+     * build timestamps. See {@link java.text.SimpleDateFormat} for details on the format.

+     * Interpolates expressions in the specified model. Note that implementations are free to either interpolate the
+     * provided model directly or to create a clone of the model and interpolate the clone. Callers should always use
+     * the returned model and must not rely on the input model being updated.
+     * 
+     * @param model The model to interpolate, must not be {@code null}.
+     * @param projectDir The project directory, may be {@code null} if the model does not belong to a local project but
+     *            to some artifact's metadata.
+     * @param request The model building request that holds further settings, must not be {@code null}.
+     * @return The interpolated model, never {@code null}.
+     * @throws ModelInterpolationException If the model could not be interpolated (e.g. due to expressions with cyclic
+     *             references).
