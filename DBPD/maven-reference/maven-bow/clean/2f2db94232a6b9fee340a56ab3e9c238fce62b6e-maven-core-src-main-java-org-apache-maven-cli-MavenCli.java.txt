Re-resolving: MNG-757

o Added it0068 to guard against regressions of the type causing MNG-836

o Added it2001, which must be run manually, to verify the test case laid out in MNG-757

o Reinstated the repository accumulation for successive traversal down the transitivity chain, so that transitively resolved artifacts can be found in repositories declared by POMs up the chain.

o Added a check for 'file:' at the beginning of the Settings.getLocalRepository() result, before prepending 'file://' to allow for relative definition of the local repository in test cases
