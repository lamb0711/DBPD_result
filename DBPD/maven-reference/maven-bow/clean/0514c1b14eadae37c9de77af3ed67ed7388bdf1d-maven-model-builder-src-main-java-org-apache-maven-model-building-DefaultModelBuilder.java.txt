[MNG-2199] Support version ranges in parent elements

o Updated to fix parent version range resolution broken since 3.2.3 and to
  remove parent version range resolution logic obsolete since Maven
  3.2.3 which changed the initialization of MavenProject instances.
o Updated local parent resolution to behave the same way remote parent
  resolution behaves. When referencing a parent using version ranges,
  inheriting the version or using version expressions should not be supported.
  It has been implemented that way for remote parent resolution as it got
  introduced in Maven 3.2.2. For local parent resolution the version in parent
  declarations had been ignored completely as of Maven 3.3.0 due to commit
  be3fb200326208ca4b8c41ebf16d5ae6b8049792 removing all local parent version
  validation. Work on fixing this is tracked by MNG-5840 released with Maven
  3.3.9. This commit adds the final missing bits to make local and remote parent
  resolution behave the same way as much as possible. As an exception, remote
  parent resolution still is a bit more strict than local parent resolution due
  to a different API in use. When resolving a parent from a repository using
  version ranges, the ModelBuilder verifies the range in use to declare an upper
  bound. When resolving a parent locally using version ranges, those ranges are
  not required to declare an upper bound because the API in use does not support
  querying that. Authoring a POM relying on this difference should be considered
  a bug.
o Added test cases to maven-core testing parent version range resolution for
  local and remote parent models.
