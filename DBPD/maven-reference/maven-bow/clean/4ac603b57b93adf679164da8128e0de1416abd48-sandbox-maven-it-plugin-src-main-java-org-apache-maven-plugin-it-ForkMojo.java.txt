Add the project itself to the 'reactorprojects' of the forked
build, so dependencies can at least resolve the target/artifact.jar.
Blacklist the project to skip building it again.

TODO: the message now printed in ReactorManager implies that that
project has build errors; that seems to be the only possible reason
to blacklist a project. Maybe if the EventDispatcher/Handler interfaces
would have more methods than start/end/error this could be handled differently.
