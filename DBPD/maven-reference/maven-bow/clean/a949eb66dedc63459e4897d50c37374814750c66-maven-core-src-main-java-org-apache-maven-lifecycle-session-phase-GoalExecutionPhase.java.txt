o Removed GoalDecorationPhase, since goal decoration is now a part of the model
o Removed PluginDownloadPhase, since plugin resolution/download has to be a part of the prereq and pre/postGoal resolution, too
o Changed DefaultMaven to execute the session lifecycle, and the component wiring to likewise wire the DefaultMaven with a session lifecycle manager
o Removed the org.apache.maven.decoration package and its contents, since this is all in the model now
o Fixed the GoalResolutionPhase to verify each goal's plugin in turn as it resolves prereqs, preGoals and postGoals
o Fixed the GoalResolutionPhaseTest to work with the new resolution model
o Added a new createGoalExecutionContext to the MavenTestCase base class, to allow me to inject a MavenProject directly rather than a pom file
o Fixed the MavenLifecycleManagerTest to only expect 4 lifecycle phases, now than the plugin resolution and goal decoration phases are obsoleted
o All builds on local machine, but will depend on plexus-0.17.jar/pom and plexus-artifact-container-1.0-alpha-1.jar/pom to build on beaver
o I uploaded plexus-artifact-container-1.0-alpha-1.jar to ${plexus.home}/dist, but cannot upload POMs due to priveleges problem in poms dir.
