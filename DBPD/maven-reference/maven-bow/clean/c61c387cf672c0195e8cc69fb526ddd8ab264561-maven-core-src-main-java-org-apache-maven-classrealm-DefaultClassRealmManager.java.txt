MNG-5513: Artifact filtering not updated for Eclipse Aether filtering

Also, please note that org.eclipse.aether.internal.impl should be imported into plugin realms, thereby restoring Maven 3.0.x style behavior which imports org.sonatype.aether.impl and sub packages (especially o.s.a.impl.internal which after the move to Eclipse is no longer a sub package of o.e.a.impl)  according to Benjamin (thanks!)

-        imports.put( "org.eclipse.aether.internal.impl", coreRealm );
