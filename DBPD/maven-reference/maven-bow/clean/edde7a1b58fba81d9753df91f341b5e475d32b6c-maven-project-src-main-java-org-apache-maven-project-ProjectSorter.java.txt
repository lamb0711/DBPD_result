PR: MNG-2603

Revert accidental commit on ProjectSorter.java in revision r462868.

I locally modified the ProjectSorter to exclude the build plugins from the DAG
to fix some cycles in the reactor when importing the entire trunk (components,
shared, scm, plugins etc..) in Eclipse. This was never meant to be committed.
