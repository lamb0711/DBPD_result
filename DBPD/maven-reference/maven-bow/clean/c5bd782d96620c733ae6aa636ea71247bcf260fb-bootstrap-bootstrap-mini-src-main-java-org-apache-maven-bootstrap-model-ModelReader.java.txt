* Fixed defaults for repositories (release true, snapshots true, layout default)

* Added support for using repositories from the poms themselves,
  including chained dependencies.
  It's not as clean as I would like to, but there's no notion of a Project:
  the repository-defining project is not added to a Dependency Chain.

* Updated DownloadFailedException to list the dep chain and the repositories
  tried.
