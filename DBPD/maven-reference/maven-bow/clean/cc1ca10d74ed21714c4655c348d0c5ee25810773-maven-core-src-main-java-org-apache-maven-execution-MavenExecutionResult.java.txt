o separating out the MavenEmbedderProjectWithExtensionReadingTest which shows that the artifacts handlers must be loaded up-front
  in the readProjectWithDependencies method because it is not being done in the core unless projects are executed. So Milos' assertion
  is correct. I'm now looking at a layered approach for project resolution and then execution so that the readProjectWithDependencies
  (which is essential for IDE integration) will yield something that can be pushed into the lifecycle executor. Right now there
  is much duplication which makes the IDE integration crappy.

  Another result of this is trying to create a simple IDE import model that gives back client code the fully resolved, topo sorted
  set of projects which point to binary dependencies outside the reactor, and to source folders inside the reactor. The result will
  be a useful model for all IDE integration, right now everyone is doing their own thing. This model will need hooks for customization
  to take into account turning "workspace resolution" on/off and allow easy overriding of this process.
