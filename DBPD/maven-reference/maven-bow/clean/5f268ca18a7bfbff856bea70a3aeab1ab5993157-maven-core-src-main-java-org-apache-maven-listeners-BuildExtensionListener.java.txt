+ * This listener has two parts: the collection of the extension elements which happens during POM construction,
+ * and the processing of the build extensions once the construction is finished and the build plan is being
+ * created. The extensions that are found can be contributed to a Mercury session where a set of artifacts
+ * are retrieved and any number of extensions may be required. We don't want to load them as they are discovered
+ * because that prevents any sort of analysis so we collect, analyze and process.

+     * in the container from any location and the right classloader will be used to execute
