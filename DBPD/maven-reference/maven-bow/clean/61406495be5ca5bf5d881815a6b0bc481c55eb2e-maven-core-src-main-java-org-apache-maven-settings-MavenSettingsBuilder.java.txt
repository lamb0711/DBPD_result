o Refactored the MavenSettings code into the settings.mdo/Settings class.

o Added code to cache the active proxy and profile inside the Settings instance for quicker lookup.

o Added a method to initialize a new active profile for a Settings instance in the event one didn't exist.

o Started adding offline mode. So far, I've implemented:

  - Warning when a mojo declares a requirement for connectivity, but we're offline.

  - INFO message stating when maven is running in offline mode.

  - Addition to the Profile class in o.a.m.settings package to allow specification of offline mode by declaring: <offline>true</offline>
