use warning instead of info

also remove unintended spaces

-       Logger.info("WARNING Using HTTP Basic Authentication over an insecure connection to download the Maven distribution. Please consider using HTTPS.");
+       Logger.warn("WARNING Using HTTP Basic Authentication over an insecure connection to download the Maven distribution. Please consider using HTTPS.");
-              throw new RuntimeException("Downloading Maven   distributions with HTTP Basic Authentication is not supported on your JVM.", java5OrEarlier);
+              throw new RuntimeException("Downloading Maven distributions with HTTP Basic Authentication is not supported on your JVM.", java5OrEarlier);
