o putting into play the use of the artifact filter during the transitive
  collection of artifacts.

  -> I was previously using a an exclude list but that was only taking into
     account the top-level pass of the artifacts so what was happening was
     things like maven-core weren't going in repeatedly but all of
     maven-core's deps were going in repeatedly. So by using the filter
     in the collector that sort of behaviour is stopped and now I can
     make the filter do anything I want to account for any weirdisms
     I subsequently encounter.
