Resolving: MNG-886

o Added complex test case for the release plugin, called it2002.
o Added copying of reportArtifacts and extensionArtifacts sets when one MavenProject is constructed with another.
o Added some logging statements to PrepareReleaseMojo, which I will remove later when I'm done with this rash of bugfixes.
