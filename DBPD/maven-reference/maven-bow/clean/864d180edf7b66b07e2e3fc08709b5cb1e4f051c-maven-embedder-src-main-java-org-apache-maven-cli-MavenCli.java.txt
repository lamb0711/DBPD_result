+     * {@code -rf :artifactId} will pick up the first module which matches, but when multiple modules in the
+     * reactor have the same artifactId, effective failed module might be later in build reactor.
+     * This means that developer will either have to type groupId or wait for build execution of all modules
+     * which were fine, but they are still before one which reported errors.
+     * <p>Then the returned value is {@code groupId:artifactId} when there is a name clash and
+     * {@code :artifactId} if there is no conflict.
+     *
+     * @param mavenProjects Maven projects which are part of build execution.
+     * @param failedProject Project which has failed.
+     * @return Value for -rf flag to resume build exactly from place where it failed ({@code :artifactId} in
+     *    general and {@code groupId:artifactId} when there is a name clash).
