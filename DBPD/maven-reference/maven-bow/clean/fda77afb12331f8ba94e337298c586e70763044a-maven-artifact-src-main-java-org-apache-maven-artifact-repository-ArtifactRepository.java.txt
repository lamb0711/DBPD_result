Resolving issue: MNG-339

o Added checksumPolicy to artifact repository construction, which meant changing all the places where the factory was called.

o Added two command-line switches (-C=strict-checksum-checking, -c=lax-checksum-checking, or warning)

o Added checksum policy to all repository definitions (profiles.mdo, settings.mdo, maven.mdo)

o Changed the maven-artifact-ant stuff to use a Repository definition with checksumPolicy added to it

NOTE: I just realized that I haven't touched the inheritance/conversion of repository stuff from profiles/settings.xml to the model. I'll do this, and commit the additional changes.

Currently, the default checksum policy is to warn, since there are still bad checksums out there that prevent bootstrapping. Once we chase these down, we can change to default-strict checking. When verifying checksums, SHA-1 is attempted first, with MD5 acting as a backup verification method. If the checksum verification fails legitimately (not related to the process of retrieving/reading the checksum file), then the verification process is repeated ONCE ONLY.
