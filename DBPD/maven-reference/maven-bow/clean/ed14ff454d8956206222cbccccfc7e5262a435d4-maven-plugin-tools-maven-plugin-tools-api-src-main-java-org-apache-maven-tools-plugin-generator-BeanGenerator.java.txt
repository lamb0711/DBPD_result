Modifying the mojo generators to handle alias, and other missing elements where appropriate. Changed the resources mojos to be as trim as I can, and added @required to the field-level annotations (this might be a good thing to do for all plexus components, dunno if it's there already)...finally, trimmed up the annotation handling in the JavaMojoDescriptorExtractor to push as many annotation fields as possible into the endangered area, and started pulling as much info from the field, other companion annotations on the field, etc. as I can...I think the annotations are there, now. They need to be cleaned up after converting all the core plugins to use field-level annotations, then we're set.

+ * [JC] Is this class defunct now? I can't find o.a.m.plugin.BeanPluginAdapter in the codebase...
+ * I'm not going to edit this class to account for aliases, deprecation, etc. until I know.
