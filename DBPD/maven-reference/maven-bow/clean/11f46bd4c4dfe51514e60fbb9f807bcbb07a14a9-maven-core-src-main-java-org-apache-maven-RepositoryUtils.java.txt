MNG-5503: Fix for the issue where Maven 3.1.0 fails to resolve artifacts produced by reactor build

The general strategy is to fall back to Aether artifact type and use its notion of identity as much as possible. I have
a simple IT taken from the sample project that I will also push.

+    public static Collection<Artifact> toArtifacts(Collection<org.apache.maven.artifact.Artifact> artifactsToConvert ) 
+    {
+        List<Artifact> artifacts = new ArrayList<Artifact>();
+        for( org.apache.maven.artifact.Artifact a : artifactsToConvert )
+        {
+            artifacts.add(toArtifact(a));
+        }
+        return artifacts;
+    }
+
