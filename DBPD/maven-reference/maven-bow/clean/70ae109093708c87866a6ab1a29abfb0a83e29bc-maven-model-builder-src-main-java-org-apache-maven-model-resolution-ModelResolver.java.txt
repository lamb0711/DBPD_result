o Added method to clone/fork model resolver which is a prerequisite for importing other POMs/mixins during the model building where the model builder basically recurses and we want the resolution processes for these sub POMs to be isolated

+     * Clones this resolver for usage in a forked resolution process. In general, implementors need not provide a deep
+     * clone. The only requirement is that invocations of {@link #addRepository(Repository)} on the clone do not affect
+     * the state of the original resolver and vice versa.
+     * 
+     * @return The cloned resolver, never {@code null}.
