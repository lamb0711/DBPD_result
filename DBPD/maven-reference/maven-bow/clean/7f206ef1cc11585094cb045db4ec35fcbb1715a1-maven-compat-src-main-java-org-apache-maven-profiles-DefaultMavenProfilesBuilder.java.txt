try-with-resources

Reformatted to code style by me. This fixes #53

-            Reader profileReader = null;
-            try
+            try ( Reader profileReader = ReaderFactory.newXmlReader( profilesXml );
+                  StringWriter sWriter = new StringWriter() )
-                profileReader = ReaderFactory.newXmlReader( profilesXml );
-
-                StringWriter sWriter = new StringWriter();
-
-                    getLogger().warn( "Failed to initialize environment variable resolver. Skipping environment "
-                                          + "substitution in " + PROFILES_XML_FILE + "." );
+                    getLogger().warn(
+                        "Failed to initialize environment variable resolver. Skipping environment " + "substitution in "
+                            + PROFILES_XML_FILE + "." );
-            finally
-            {
-                IOUtil.close( profileReader );
-            }
+
