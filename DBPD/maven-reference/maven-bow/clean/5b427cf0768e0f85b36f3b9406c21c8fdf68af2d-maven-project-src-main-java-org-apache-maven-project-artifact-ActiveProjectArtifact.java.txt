Applied patches, with minor changes.

These patches will ensure that the optional flag is passed on and inherited correctly when dealing with managed dependencies.

I changed the patches, in that I added a new createDependencyArtifact(..) method on ArtifactFactory, which will eliminate the need to call an older variant of the method by passing in a null value for the inheritedScope parameter.
