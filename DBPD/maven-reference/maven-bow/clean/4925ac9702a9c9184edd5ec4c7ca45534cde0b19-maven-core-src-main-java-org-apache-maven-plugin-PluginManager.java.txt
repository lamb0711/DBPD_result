o removing deprecated code in the plugin mechanism

o examining how plugin version resolution is done, and we have a mix of a desire to use snapshots locally and pull releases
  remotely. if the repositories are mixed a snapshot will be pull automagically. this doesn't happen in practice but snapshots
  for plugin versions should be limited to a local search only.
