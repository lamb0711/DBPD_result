[MNG-2302] Added code to nullify parent's descriptor location in cases where the parent MavenProject instance was loaded from the repository. In these cases, the descriptor location value is incorrect anyway, and it was causing an incorrect null return value for MavenProject.getModulePathAlignment(..), which in turn produces an incorrect URL path calculation for multi-tiered inheritance where the top tiers are resolved from the repository.
