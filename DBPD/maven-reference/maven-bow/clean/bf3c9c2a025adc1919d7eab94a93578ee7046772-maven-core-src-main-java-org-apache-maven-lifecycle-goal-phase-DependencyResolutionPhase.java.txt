o Replaced Model/MavenXpp3Reader with MavenProjectBuilder in MavenMetaDataSource,
  to take advantage of the post-processing (managed dependencies, pom interpolation,
  inheritance assembly) involved with building a project. This shoud make transitive
  dependency resolution more consistent with the rest of m2's handling of
  POM information.

  It has been tested on marmalade in the jelly-core taglib, but
  I'm not sure how to setup an integration test using the it-verifier
  to build multiple POMs in a single test, so I'm not sure how to
  setup an integration test for this.
