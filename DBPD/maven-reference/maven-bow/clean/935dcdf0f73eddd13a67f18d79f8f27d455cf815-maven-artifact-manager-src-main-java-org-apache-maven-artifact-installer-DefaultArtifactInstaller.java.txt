PR: MNG-613
revert previous flushing of metadata as not all metadata is attached during transformation
instead fix the problem of setting of local copy directly

git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/components/trunk@280349 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68

-            artifact.getMetadataList().clear();
+            // TODO: would like to flush this, but the plugin metadata is added in advance, not as an install/deploy transformation
+            // This would avoid the need to merge and clear out the state during deployment
+//            artifact.getMetadataList().clear();
