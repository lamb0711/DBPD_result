Resolving: MNG-878, MNG-921

o Verified that plugins are added to the list in the model when invoked from the command line (878)
o Reformatted ModelUtils after the profiles-cloning addition
o Added cache-flush for the plugin map in MavenProject
o Moved dependencies for subproject/subproject2 into the parent-project POM, inside a profile
o Added activation property for this new profile into the test.sh script
o Added explicit activation inside of release:perform's m2 invocation for all profile-ids active in the release-plugin's execution.
o Added code to remove the dynamic parts of the POM from the release-pom.xml...it's not meant to be a dynamic version of a POM.
