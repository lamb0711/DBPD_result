[MNG-6078] Undo the order reversal hack

- ca4303031357a7decaee8de770b71fb2c2fedd28 used a hack to reverse the order of arguments
- The side effect of the hack is that the first named system property value on the CLI would win
- The side-effect is causing a lot of integration test builds to fail and will likely have other unintended consequences
- Correct fix is to put system properties at the end.
- If this change passes the integration tests then it will need to be augmented to correctly round-trip the CLI options
  as there is the potential that somebody may legitimately be passing an arg parameter a value that starts with -D
  for example 'mvn -ep -Dsecretpassword' or 'mvn -l -D.log' but given that this requires a parse and unparse
  to handle the escaping, I want to get evidence that the integration tests pass first
