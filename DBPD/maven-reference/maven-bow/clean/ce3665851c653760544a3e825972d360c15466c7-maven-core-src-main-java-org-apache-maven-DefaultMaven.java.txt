o Re-adding support for user-level settings which are not assumed to be in ~ (for continuum and other server-style apps' convenience)

o Adding support for global (installation-level) settings.xml file which is identical to the one in ~/.m2, and which will be overridden by user-level settings. The default location for this is ${maven.home}/settings.xml.

o Adding IT to test merging of global- and user-level settings.xml files

o Moved DefaultMavenSettingsBuilder/MavenSettingsBuilder to maven-settings project, to make them more generally available (to ant, for instance)

Resolves issue: MNG-294
