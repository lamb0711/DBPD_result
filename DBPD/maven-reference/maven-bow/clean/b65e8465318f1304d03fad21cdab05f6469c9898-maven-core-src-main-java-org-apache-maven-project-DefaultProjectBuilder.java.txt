[MNG-6716] Avoid setting compileRoots

Recent changes in ProjectBuilder make that the compile roots could be
set erroneously on 1st phase and propagated in the results.
This patch just skips setting the compile source root in the 1st pass
(when buildParentIfNonExisting==false).

It also tests some other fields of MavenProject

This closes #274

-        if ( project.getFile() != null )
+        if ( project.getFile() != null && buildParentIfNotExisting ) // only set those on 2nd phase, ignore on 1st pass
