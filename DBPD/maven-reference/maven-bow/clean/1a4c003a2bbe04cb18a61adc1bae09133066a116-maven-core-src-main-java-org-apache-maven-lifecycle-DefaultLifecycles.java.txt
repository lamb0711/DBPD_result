MNG-5349: Make sure lifecycles have and id. When we switch to JSR330 I would prefer to use private final fields in Lifecycle.java and use the Precondition.assertNotNull check. This will serve for now.

+import com.google.common.base.Preconditions;
+
-            result.add( lifecycles.get( name ) );
+            Lifecycle lifecycle = lifecycles.get( name );
+            Preconditions.checkNotNull( "A lifecycle must have an id.", lifecycle.getId() );
+            result.add( lifecycle );
-        for ( Lifecycle lifecycle : lifecycles.values() )
+        for ( Lifecycle lifecycle : getLifeCycles() )
