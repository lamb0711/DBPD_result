o Restored original behavior of legacy resolution methods (every client and not just Surefire that calls the old methods expects the root artifact to not be resolved as in 2.x now)

-        // This is an extreme hack because of the ridiculous APIs we have a root that is disconnected and
-        // useless. The SureFire plugin passes in a dummy root artifact that is actually used in the production
-        // plugin ... We have no choice but to put this hack in the core.
