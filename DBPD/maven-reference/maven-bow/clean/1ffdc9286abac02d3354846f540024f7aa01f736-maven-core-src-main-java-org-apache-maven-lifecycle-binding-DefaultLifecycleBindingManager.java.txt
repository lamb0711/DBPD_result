o start the grand plugin refactoring, just putting it all together in addition to putting all the repository/artifact calls
  behind the repository system you can see project and plugins being processed an incredible number of times and the recursion
  in the collector is broken causing POMs for plugins to be processed hundreds of times. The bootstrap under profiling reveals
  the xpp3 parser being used almost 30k times which is pure insanity.
