Mapping in most of the rest of the maven-core errors to the error reporter...just need to finish the ExtensionManagerException mappings, then write error reports for the new mappings from today, and we should be in good shape.

-            // TODO: This shouldn't be required, now that we're checking the core filter before getting here.
-            if ( !extensionArtifact.isResolved() || ( extensionArtifact.getFile() == null ) )
-            {
-                throw new ExtensionManagerException( "Extension artifact was not resolved, or has no file associated with it.", extensionArtifact, projectGroupId, projectArtifactId, projectVersion );
-            }
