Fixing CI process. Children of system scoped deps were not being excluded properly...I had marked it to exclude the system scoped dep as well.



git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/components/trunk@332317 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68

-        if ( node.isActive() )
+        // don't pull in the transitive deps of a system-scoped dependency.
+        if ( node.isActive() && !Artifact.SCOPE_SYSTEM.equals( node.getArtifact().getScope() ) )
