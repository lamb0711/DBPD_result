[MNG-6644] don't fail if no input location tracking available

this can happen when the POM is not parsed by Maven core from XML
-                addDom( reports, "report", report, location.getLocation( n++ ) );
+                addDom( reports, "report", report, ( location == null ) ? null : location.getLocation( n++ ) );
