Generalized error diagnosis for use outside of maven-core. This allows us to print diagnostic messages in the Ant tasks, for instance (these modifications are also included), and share diagnosers between multiple uses (maven-core, maven-artifact-ant, for example). This should help with MNG-784, but I'll verify that before I close it.
