include optional direct dependencies in classpath and resolve artifacts.
These are not included in project.getTestArtifacts() while they should be required if dependency is direct (seems to be a problem only with reactor projects).
Modified master test in order to manually check file content instead of comparing files (easier to explain and comment, ignore order).
