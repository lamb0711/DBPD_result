[MNG-3004] Concurrent building of multimodule projects

This commit consists of a modularization of the DefaultLifecycleExecutor into smaller
components. This is primarily done with the intention of extracting execution strategy 
somewhat from the rest of the logic.

It also contains three differenent execution strategies:
A) Linear ("Classic")
B) Parallel (Based on Dan's original implemementation)
C) Weave (Still experimental) 

 
The command line -T option activates parallel running, and the argument
is in the form -T <[nThreads, a float][C][W]|auto>

Notes:
* The output demultiplexer is disabled in this commit, and output will appear intermingled.
* The modello plugin has known problems
* Surefire must be run in forkmode at least once.
