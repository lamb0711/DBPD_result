Added a note on project sorting and cycles.

+    // MAVENAPI FIXME: the DAG used is NOT only used to represent the dependency relation,
+    // but also for <parent>, <build><plugin>, <reports>. We need multiple DAG's
+    // since a DAG can only handle 1 type of relationship properly.
+    // Usecase:  This is detected as a cycle:
+    // org.apache.maven:maven-plugin-api                -(PARENT)->
+    // org.apache.maven:maven                           -(inherited REPORTING)->
+    // org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-checkstyle-plugin -(DEPENDENCY)->
+    // org.apache.maven:maven-plugin-api
+    // In this case, both the verify and the report goals are called
+    // in a different lifecycle. Though the compiler-plugin has a valid usecase, although
+    // that seems to work fine. We need to take versions and lifecycle into account.
