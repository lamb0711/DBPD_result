o clean up the dependencies in the POM, i really only need to depend on the
  core and everything else will come in transitively
  
o rolling things back to use the 2.0 release maven artifacts, i can
  subsequently, deploy 2.0.1-SNAPSHOTs and when 2.0.1 is released I will
  release 2.0.1 of the embedder. I think the releases of the embedder must
  follow closely on the heels of Maven itself.
