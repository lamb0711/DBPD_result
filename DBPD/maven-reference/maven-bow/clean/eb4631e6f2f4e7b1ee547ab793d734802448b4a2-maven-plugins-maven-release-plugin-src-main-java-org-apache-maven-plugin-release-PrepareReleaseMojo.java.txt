o the getScm() call creates a new instance of the scm bean so I corrected some
  spots where it was being used because it was assuming the target/checkout
  directory for the prepare phase. this needs a touch of work but i left
  it pretty much as is to get it working. i have successfully prepared
  for the release and now i'm going to try and perform the release.

+            scm.setWorkingDirectory( basedir );
+
-            getScm().tag();
+            scm.tag();
