o unifying anythign to do with artifact resolution into one module                                                                               
o maven-artifact-test not used                                                                                                                   
o maven-artifact-manager is not consumed separate anywhere as the ant tasks are now an uber jar                                                  
o i'm fine with having a proper maven-artifact-api jar but it's leaking all over the place and the api is out of control
