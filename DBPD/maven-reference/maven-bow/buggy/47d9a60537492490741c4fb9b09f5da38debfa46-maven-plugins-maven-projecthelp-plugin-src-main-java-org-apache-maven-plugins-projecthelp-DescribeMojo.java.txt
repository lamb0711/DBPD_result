Working on: MNG-786

o Changed the profile activation in it0075 to use a system property which is not always present

o Added projecthelp:active-profiles, package, and clean:clean to the goals list, in case it was only happening with the clean plugin

o Fixed the projecthelp mojos to be aggregators where appropriate

o Changed the ordering of modules in the profile injector (used to be that profile modules were prepended; now, they're appended)

NOTE: I still cannot reproduce the described behavior. Dan: Am I missing something WRT the test setup? I changed the activation trigger to be non-inherent, and I'm not using a boolean string to trigger the profile. What am I doing wrong??
