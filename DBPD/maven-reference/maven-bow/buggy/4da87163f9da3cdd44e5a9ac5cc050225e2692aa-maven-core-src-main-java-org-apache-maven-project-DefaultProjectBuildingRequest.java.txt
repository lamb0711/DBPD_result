Added synchronization around copying system properties since they are a singleton,

fix for [MRRESOURCES-65] and similar problem in assembly

-            this.systemProperties.putAll( systemProperties );
+            synchronized ( systemProperties )
+            { // avoid concurrentmodification if someone else sets/removes an unrelated system property
+                this.systemProperties.putAll( systemProperties );
+            }
