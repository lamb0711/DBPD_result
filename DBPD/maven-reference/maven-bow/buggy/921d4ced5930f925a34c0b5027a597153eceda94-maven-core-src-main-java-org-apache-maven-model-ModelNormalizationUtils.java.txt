o Started maven-projecthelp-plugin to help with build analysis (this helped me to visualize profile stuff)
   current goals:
     projecthelp:active-profiles
     projecthelp:effective-pom

o Added source attribute to the Profile model class in maven-model, along with code in the normalization utilities (converters from profiles.xml and settings.xml models to maven-model instances) to identify the source of a particular profile.

o Added a activeProfiles cache of the Profiles in effect for the current project, on the MavenProject class
