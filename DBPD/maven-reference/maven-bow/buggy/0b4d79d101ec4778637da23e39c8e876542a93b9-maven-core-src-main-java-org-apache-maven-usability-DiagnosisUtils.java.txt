Resolving: MNG-1032, MNG-1033

o Improved the error diagnostics related to artifact resolution errors.

o Added xml-based documentation of supported plugin parameter expressions, including info about how to affect them ('-o' for example), how to specify them (<distributionManagement><repository/> for example in ${project.distributionManagementArtifactRepository}), and what the expressions are actually used for. This can also serve as a basis for creating documentation for plugin parameter expressions on the website.

o Improved the error diagnostics for plugin configuration errors.

o Added a couple of ITs in the 1000 series to test these two error conditions.
