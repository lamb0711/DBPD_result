o put all of the path functions back into the artifact handler manager - that class likely needs a rename.
o Removed AbstractArtifactComponent as it was simply delegating to the class and prevented other inheritence for the resolver which seems more appropriate.
o fixed test failure in ProjectClasspathTest due to incorrectly constructed component - using plexus even though still working around the problem with a hack
