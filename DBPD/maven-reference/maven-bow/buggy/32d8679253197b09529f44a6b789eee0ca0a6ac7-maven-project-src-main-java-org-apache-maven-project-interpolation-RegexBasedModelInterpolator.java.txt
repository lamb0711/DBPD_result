[MNG-2186] correct the regression of MNG-1927 from the solution of MNG-2124
The interpolator was only working based on an incorrect assumption for a limited set of expressions. This assumption is
guaranteed by the solution in the interim, until it can be properly reconsidered. The proper solution would be to not
cache an interpolated model, and to apply path translation and then interpolation after retrieving the cached model. However,
this will require some other related changes and should be planned for 2.1.
