o changed the inheritanceApplied flag to be set by default, and unset if the plugin is merged to the child without <inherit/> being specified...this makes it work with isolated POMs.
o changed the semantics of when the unsetInheritanceApplied() method is called...it's now only when <inherit/> is NOT set.
o changed the default inheritByDefault attribute on MojoDescriptor to be true
o added inheritByDefault to PluginDescriptor (even though we don't have tools supporting it yet), with semantics identical to MojoDescriptor
o added generator/builder support for the inheritByDefault attribute of PluginDescriptor
o added calculation of inheritanceApplied || inheritByDefault to lifecycle executor before allowing plugins/mojos to bind.
o Everything builds, but we need some sort of IT to test the finer points.
