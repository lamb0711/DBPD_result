- * Responsible for creating a plan of execution for a given project and list of tasks. This build plan
- * consists of MojoBinding instances that carry all the information necessary to execute a mojo,
- * including configuration from the POM and other sources. NOTE: the build plan may be constructed
- * of a main lifecycle binding-set, plus any number of lifecycle modifiers and direct-invocation
- * modifiers, to handle cases of forked execution.
