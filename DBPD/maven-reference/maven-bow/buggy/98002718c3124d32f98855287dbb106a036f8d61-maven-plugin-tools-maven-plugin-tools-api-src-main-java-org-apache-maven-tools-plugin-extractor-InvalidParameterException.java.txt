o Refactored mojo/plugin generation, extraction, etc. to accommodate multiple mojo languages.
o Tested with java mojos, mboot to verify nothing broken by refactor.
o TODO: Add marmalade support tests...currently only java-mojos are supported in mboot2, so this isn't going to interrupt things.
o TODO: Once marmalade support is tested, add to the list of artifacts built by mboot2.
