try-with-resources

Reformatted to code style by me. This fixes #53

-import org.codehaus.plexus.util.IOUtil;
-                    InputStream is = pluginJar.getInputStream( pluginDescriptorEntry );
-
-                    try
+                    try ( InputStream is = pluginJar.getInputStream( pluginDescriptorEntry ) )
-                    finally
-                    {
-                        IOUtil.close( is );
-                    }
-                InputStream is = new BufferedInputStream( new FileInputStream( pluginXml ) );
-                try
+                try ( InputStream is = new BufferedInputStream( new FileInputStream( pluginXml ) ) )
-                finally
-                {
-                    IOUtil.close( is );
-                }
