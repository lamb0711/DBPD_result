(Merged from 384264.) [MNG-2124] Fixed interpolator to call the ReflectionValueExtractor method that prevents trimming the first expression token, since this is done in the interpolator itself. I'm still investigating whether this is going to break realignment of File instances to basedir during plugin parameter injection, but I've had to adjust it0088, since it is not handling project.build.directory as a File, but as a String.

-                    value = ReflectionValueExtractor.evaluate( realExpr, model );
+                    // NOTE: We've already trimmed off any leading expression parts like 'project.'
+                    // or 'pom.', and now we have to ensure that the ReflectionValueExtractor 
+                    // doesn't try to do it again.
+                    value = ReflectionValueExtractor.evaluate( realExpr, model, false );
